My ordeal began with an extended delay at the airport that quickly turned into an overnight stay, largely due to the airline's lack of communication and support. Initially, our flight was delayed, and after waiting for about four hours, it was eventually canceled. Throughout this period, there was minimal information provided about the situation, leaving passengers confused and frustrated. To add to the inconvenience, the airline offered no immediate assistance in rebooking our flight, which only compounded the stress of the situation. While Air New Zealand did provide hotel and meal vouchers, the experience with these compensations was far from satisfactory. The hotel we were directed to did not accept the vouchers due to delays in payment processing by the airline. This left us scrambling for alternative accommodations and additional expenses. The next leg of our journey was similarly marred by issues. The second flight was delayed again, this time due to a broken plane. The airline had to find a new aircraft and transfer catering, further prolonging our travel experience and adding to the frustration. One of the most frustrating aspects of this ordeal has been the difficulty in resolving the financial implications of the delays. Efforts to seek reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses on hotels and meals were met with a series of excuses, slow responses, and an overall lack of effective communication. Reaching a customer service representative was challenging, and when contact was made, responses were often unhelpful and evasive. Overall, my experience with Air New Zealand was far from satisfactory. The combination of poor communication, inadequate support, and slow reimbursement processes has left a lasting negative impression. For anyone considering flying with Air New Zealand, I recommend being prepared for potential disruptions and ensuring you have a contingency plan in place.",Negative,Negative,Neutral,2024,raratonga,,auckland,NZ,Taipei,False

Air New Zealand has to be the worst in condescending service and unnecessary process. I’m writing this review after 5 flights with them in the last 10 days (and unfortunately another 3 to go). The boarding process is peculiar with word choices such as “you can board when invited”. To be clear I wait till I’m called and don’t understand the notion of people jumping queues. But the word choice of invite is the first passive aggressive experience as part of the flight experience A week ago I flew Air NZ and for the first time in my life I was reprimanded by the hostess for not watching (I was listening) the in flight safety. I told her I’m listening and she said “well you should watch” Checking in today my bag was 32.7kg. I appreciate there needs to be a limit, but there’s no discretion. I’m flying business class for a three week trip. I then removed a few items and the scale said 32.0kg. I was then told it has to be under 32 which necessitated me to refute that point. Grudgingly, the person then put the case through and gave me the *sigh* treatment. Getting onto the flight, the first thing the host says is the incoming flight’s passengers “ was a 9 out of 10, so you have a high standard to live up to”. Whilst I 100% understand this was meant in humour, it’s symptomatic of an airline that doesn’t want to serve. These experiences alongside poor food on the flights, no pyjamas on overnight business and frankly the weirdest business class layout with no privacy makes this an airline to avoid. Unless of course you want to feel like you’re being done a favour for something you paid for. It’s relatively good value for money (at prices that are still stubbornly high) but you need to take into consideration the places they skimp on.

I certainly will not fly them again - my experience was so poor that I will go so far as to change my travel plans to avoid flying with them.

Your ticket gets you a seat only - you need to pay extra for a suitcase, a seat to ensure you and anyone you are traveling with can sit together (yes, they will separate you even if you purchase tickets together), and changes (even if the other flight has open seats). My second concern is the abysmal customer service. Gate agents are unable to help and require you to leave security for any and all questions. My gate agent was lovely enough to yell at me that she would not be able to help me before I even asked my question (I wish I was exaggerating). My experience with the help desk was worse.

Their response was a condescending, “too much, hun. Your flight is only in two hours.

I called again the day before we were due to check in on the next leg of our trip.

I showed the tickets and asked that they look on the computer as a note had been left - all to no avail so we paid $88 US per extra bag and then tried to claim this back from air New Zealand. I managed to make contact with the CFO and was assured a refund would occur that day and that we would have no further issues. I got the refund a week later after chasing it up myself.

There is not one positive thing that I can say about Air New Zealand. Customer Service never answer the telephone.

Sadly no, the passenger sitting next to me was very large and the seats very small, he put up the arm rest and occupied half of my seat plus all of his own throughout the entire flight.

I discreetly complained to the cabin crew and asked to be moved, however they just laughed, told me the flight was full and studiously ignored me for the rest of the flight.

Here we were abandoned by Air New Zealand, but only after they announced that there was no accommodation available in Christchurch and there would be no flights back to Auckland for at least two days.

Obviously it is not possible to get help or complain to Air New Zealand by telephone because they never answer the phone. I did however email my complaints and surprisingly received a relatively quick response asking for all the information a second time.

Regarding the seating arrangements they simply said that they were sorry and that there is nothing they can do when situations such as this arise.

I majorly regret giving them the benefit of the doubt. Firstly our flight was cancelled for ""operational reasons"". When the customers quizzed the ground staff they outright lied to us and said a weather event had forced the flight to be cancelled (What they didn't count on was one of the passengers being a travel agent who quickly called the girls at their contact centre and found out they lied). Absolutely no coordination from the ground crew, just told to stand by until the Air NZ contact centre rebooked us or go back to our hotels etc. I had just driven 3 days from Alice Springs across Australia to essentially be lied to and then told to go away. Most of us were rebooked for flights around half an hour later well after Christmas, some not getting home until as late as New Years Eve on rebookings.

Spoke to the travel agent passenger and she had cleverly managed to get herself onto a diversion flight to the Gold Coast before connecting with another Air NZ flight to NZ just in time for Christmas. All at no additional cost as per their legal requirements to make alternative plans for you if fair and reasonable etc. I call the call centre to try to make this arrangement also (given The Works ticket I have), get told that they can do this but I have to PAY for myself to get to the Gold Coast. I confront the staff on the front desk at the airport about this and they sheepishly ignore me, I confirm with the travel agent passenger again if she had to pay and was I entitled to do so like her? She confirms no she didn't have to pay and yes I was entitled to this. I put the questions to them assertively and they attempt to objection handle me (I seriously hate when customer service reps treat customers like their heads are filled with rocks). I speak to a woman from SwissPort who is standing next to them watching all this going on and she very kindly intervenes, confirms what I've been told by the travel agent passenger is the truth, gets me onto a Virgin flight within a matter of less than 60 seconds and the Air NZ crew sheepishly pretend they didn't just shaft me and that someone else from a different organisation actually fixed the issue. Pathetic. But I find a last-minute airport motel room and call it a day. The next day, I head to the Gold Coast. When I land, my bags go missing despite them supposed to be transferred through and waiting with Air NZ for loading. Fortunately, a kind soul from Air NZ actually assisted me with this but arguably it shouldn't happen. Lastly, while the cabin crew on the flight were very nice I got no hot meal. A minor thing by this point but missing bags, cancelled flights, no meal and an appalling response for a 1200 dollar ticket has confirmed what a few travelling Kiwi friends had warned. Air NZ is really starting to slip and its embarrassing.",Positive,Negative,Negative,2023,melbourne,AU,christchurch,NZ,,False

As a tourist from another country, you always feel unwelcomed by such acts and suspects about differential treatment becomes evident. In general, people in NZ and Aus are awesome and very welcoming but this incident really shook my opinion about Air New Zealand and its hospitality. When we put our bags, she charges NZD 20 for an additional 300 gms which was actually balances by lower weight of the other bag but the disappointment cane from she not being helpful in finding a solution.

2023-01-07,a very disappointing experience,5,Not informed,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Tokyo,January 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,-1.0,3.0,False,2.0,True,"I booked the ticket with Air New Zealand using my miles with Air Canada. It was a direct flight from Auckland to Tokyo. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. The ground staff I encountered was unfriendly and unhelpful to say the least. The ground staff member did not listen to my answers, so I had to repeat my final destination three times. Then she kept asking me for the Japanese resident card although I told her twice that I was a Japanese citizen travelling with a Japanese passport, which she was already holding. I asked for an aisle seat, and she never responded to my request. I was assigned seat 63K, a window seat in the last row of the plane. That caused inconvenience not just for me, but for the family who was sitting next to me and travelling with young children. As I was at the airport three hours before the departure and there was no online check-in, I find it difficult to believe that there were no aisle seats available at the time of my check-in. I understand the planes can be full and not all customers' requests can be met, but that should be communicated. I still do not know whether the staff member who ""assisted"" with my check-in did not hear my request, was not able to fulfil it or simply chose to ignore it. I travel often and I have been through many airports and check-in counters. I rarely encountered staff that was as unfriendly and unhelpful as the staff that I encountered at the Air New Zealand encounter on January 6, 2023. In-flight service also needs improvement. The meals were basic and repetitive. Fudge brownie was served three times during the 10-hour flight? There was no amenity kit that is standard on most international flights. The movie selection was also poor. In addition, the crew did not seem to pay attention to the passengers. When drinks were served between the meals (which happened rarely), the crew seemed to notice only the passengers seating in the aisle seats. My general impression was that they did not seem to recognise that they were there to serve the customers. Compared to Asian airlines like ANA or Korean Air, Air New Zealand service leaves a lot to be desired. Considerable improvements are needed if Air New Zealand is to compete on the global stage. I would think twice before booking the ticket with them again.",Negative,Negative,Neutral,2023,auckland,NZ,tokyo,JP,,False

Tablets and laptops will bend or snap if you attempt to store them here. The seats also offer only a half seat that doesn’t come to the back of your knees even for very short people. The portion size for meals are smaller than the size of an iPhone 14 Pro Max (not an exaggeration) and meal choices were limited after the first 9 rows as they had run out.

The problem with Air New Zealand is their attitude with their constant rescheduling and cancellations, they don't care. If I ran my business like Air New Zealand does I would be out of business as they don't care about the customer and the upheaval they create on each flight. Prime example is my last flight (and almost every flight) I finally get 3 days away from work to fly away and again a last minute cancellation which I had to rebook and we loss 1 day of our 3 day holiday ... this doesn't sound like a big deal but since lock downs this was our first weekend off and since I work 7 days a week this was a holiday I was really looking forward to it. Then on the way home another rescheduling by Air New Zealand. If you ring up to complain, expect over 1 hour (I gave up after 1 1/2hrs) on hold.

My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated.

Our connecting flight was with Qatar who obviously have different hand luggage requirements than Air NZ. However as we were trying to get through security and to note ""we were the only ones passing through security"". The male Aviation Security officer who was supposed to screen our bags refused to let us screen our bags stating we could only take 1 piece of luggage onto the aircraft. We explained that we were actually traveling internationally and had already called and confirmed with Qatar Airways that our carry on was acceptable however he insisted that he was unable to screen our bags as it wasn't the acceptable carry on allowance for the Air NZ flight. He stated we would have to check in our hand luggage so we returned downstairs by which time the flight was already closed and we were told by Air NZ staff it was ok to take our hand luggage and to board the plane. Upon returning to Av Sec, another Air NZ service agent who saw us talking with the agent who had checked us in had followed us up to the Aviation Security and as the Av Sec officer again began berating us and firmly insisting that we must leave behind all hand luggage with the exception of a laptop the Air NZ service agent began to join in stating ""Either you leave everything except your laptop behind or you are going to miss your flight"". Even with my pregnant wife beginning to cry this continued on with being pressured to leave behind our hand luggage except a laptop each and my wife's wedding dress with the Av Sec officer continuing to raise his voice and at one point even throwing plastic security tray towards me and in a raised and angry tone stating ""Don't you know laptops have to be placed inside the trays!"". After some minutes of this the Air NZ service agent realized that such actions of herself and the Av Sec officer we beginning to escalate too much and reminded the Av Sec officer that he wasn't allowed to be throwing the plastic security trays around and to be careful in front of the other staff.

Crew probably very happy to be working again, but this is how passengers expect a flight to be, even with lower fares. Aircraft was slightly less than half full, thus plenty of space for the 3 hour plus flight. The staff were so friendly and being an inaugural flight, sparkling wine was flowing freely. Comfortable seats with great video screens which were simple to use. I particularly liked the screen based ordering for drinks and food: Very professional and easy.

Crew were a little less friendly, but very pleasant nonetheless. I ordered and paid for a drink by card (brilliant!). Later an announcement was made that the service was soon closing. I ordered another drink and paid, but this time, it was not delivered to me. I'm not sure if another passenger received a free drink, or whether the aircraft system failed between the time of my order and the service closing. I have pursued this with the airline, and I am waiting on a response from them. Sadly, the return flight was almost empty. There were approximately 30 to 35 passengers on the flight, in an aircraft which seats about 180 passengers. The amount of space was enjoyable, but this does not bode well for a permanent flight on this sector. An Airline needs to make a profit, and I am hoping that passenger numbers will increase.

Ten days after this, a week before I was due to fly, I received a second email confirming the time changes from the first, however Air New Zealand had also discreetly changed the date to 3 weeks later, while maintaining the exact same time. I noticed the change two days prior to flying and called the airline in a panic. After being kept on hold, I spoke to a robot like woman who did not once apologise for a) their emails being incorrect b) the fact they had changed the flight dates at all. She provided no solutions, and no reimbursements. There was no way for my to get to Sydney, so in the end I had to pay £800 extra to book a Singapore Airlines operated by Air NZ flight home direct from Auckland. I missed my flight from Sydney to London, the cost of which I have to refrain myself from thinking about as it makes my heart race every time. The customer service was unhelpful - tried to put me on hold, push me to speak to another team, got the dates for the day I wanted to fly which then meant an increase of prices, and incorrectly hold me the price I had eventually forked out also included an extra bag. At the airport that 24kg extra bag was going to cost me $500 on account of Air NZ having a ridiculous fee of $250 per 23kg. If you exceed this there is no oversized fee, but you have to pay for an additional bag. In the end, as I was flying through Singapore Airlines operated by Air NZ the very kind gentleman at the counter (who was on the phone to Air NZ getting rates) took pity on me and wavered the fee. He apologised for Air NZ, and said in times like this when we're all just desperate to get home we need to be kind. That's the attitude I would expect of New Zealand national airline. I will never fly Air NZ ever again. The service I received was worse than budget airlines such as Easy Jet and Ryanair who I always expect to be trying to take my money at every turn. I would not have expected this of Air NZ who leave me £1000 poorer than I was 10 days ago for no reason at all.

We bought a flight for today. The flight is from Auckland to Houston. The problem is that they just allowed one 23kg bag per person, so, my partner and me decided to pay an extra bag. This one supposed to be cheaper if we would have payed online, but as the flight has a connection from LA to Houston with United Airlines, we couldn’t do it online. When we called, the customer service attendant told us that the extra bag is going to be 250NZD plus 160NZD of the heavy charge. We didn’t thought that this total payment will be 500NZD in total. They charged 250NZD because of the extra bag and 250NZD because the latter was 32kg. If we had known this, we would have pay 2 extra bag of 250NZD. If you do the maths, they are charging for 46kg and we are carrying on just 32kg. This is how air companies still the money from customers, even in this hard situation that the world is going through. Not even our belongings in that bag have this value, but they are really important for us, so we couldn’t leave it behind. A last thing to add, the front desk attendant was the worst ever. He didn’t even let us explain him the situation, interrupted all the time.

This left me worried for my safety and my health. I can not believe an airline would treat a customer in such a disgusting manner and it has left a very bitter taste in my mouth. Thankfully my children weren't with me on this occasion.  Finally I was able to get on a flight back to Dunedin the next day.

So when we arrived at LAX via SeaTac we went to look for a customer service agent. There were no customer service agents so we tried to talk to someone at the gate of a flight leaving earlier than ours.

He then proceeded to scan our passports (our final destination was Australia where my husband is from) and told me my visa to Australia had been denied. I told him I had a confirmation email that it was approved and gave him the confirmation number. He proceeded to call Australian immigration to figure out what was going on. After he had scanned my passport the first time my husband walked around the desk so he could see the computer screen. The man proceeded to scan my passport at least 15 more times and told me it showed up denied every time, but my husband could see the computer was popping up that my visas were approved.

Lastly I went to the bathroom and as I got out and started walking back to my seat I noticed one of the attendants walking down the same aisle so I started to back up towards the bathroom so he could go by rather than trying to shuffle past each other and as he got closer to me he made a shooing motion and said “GO, GO” and then sat in the back to gossip with all the other flight attendants that were sitting back there.

Disappointing change for the worst. The decision to change marketing of your seats/tickets on the basis of seat cost and separate extra charges for food, drinks, and entertainment is appalling. Only the discount airlines such as Jetstar and virgin employ this type of ticketing and are transparent about it. Obviously, Air New Zealand has lost its image as a premium airline to resort to this type of non transparent marketing. This situation was highlighted when we travelled over Christmas 2019, when four of our Family members visited Australia. We were very disappointed with the flight and service. We were not made aware of the extras required when booking our flights and therefore had no food, drinks and entertainment as expected. After paying $700 plus each we expected full service, not just a seat. On his separate return flight to NZ, my Brother experienced a terrible and uncomfortable flight with no cabin air conditioning. When he asked flight staff about the situation, they were uncaring and unfriendly. The baggage check in policy has also changed, and is so unfair, as each passenger is allowed 1x23kg bag. Two of us had one (1) bag each and my 9 year old Daughter had two (2) small bags with a combined weight of 17kg - well below the allowable 23kg. Total combined weight of all check in baggage was 64kg - below the allowable 69kg. No consideration or attempt was made to assist only a demand to pay a $160 fee. Air New Zealand staff Immediately demanded payment of $160 for this situation, and then an additional $160 as one of the other bags was 1.6kg overweight. Your staff were unfriendly, arrogant, and not prepared to offer any solution until one of the  male staff members came to our rescue and was willing to help with our problem. Other reputable airlines do not treat check in baggage in this way. They are prepared to look at the situation make allowances using combined weight if there is a problem. Based on our experience, we will fly Qantas in future, not Air New Zealand. We have used the discount airlines such as Jetstar and Virgin Pacific in the past and had a far better experience and paid a lot less for the flight.",Negative,Negative,Negative,2020,brisbane,AU,auckland,NZ,,False

I haven't flown Air New Zealand since 2011, and I was looking forward to using them again. I had only ever had good experiences with this airline, and expected no different this time. Perhaps I was spoiled the last time I few to NZ because I traveled on American Airlines' B787, and it was a pleasant experience. But then, I have also traveled on Air New Zealand's 777 before, and enjoyed that, so I really don't know what has changed. However, the fact is, my well-seasoned (25+ years) rolling carry on would not fit down the aisle once I got to steerage, and I was forced to turn it sideways and lift it. It wasn't that I couldn't make it fit, but I had to slightly angle it each time I went past a seat. This probably should have been a warning sign! My seat was uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that my left buttock became positively painful. Not sore, painful. It felt like I was sitting on some kind of ridge. The seat was hard, and I suffered cramps for 24 hours after landing as a result. Although I was lucky enough to have a free seat next to me (the plane was full), the shape of the seats made it such that it really wasn't the benefit that perhaps it could have been. Now, the cabin crew was good, and I'm not faulting the service, although it would have been nice if water could have been brought around more than once. The entertainment was fine, and I loved the free wifi, USB port and socket for every seat. The temperature seemed to vary a lot from cold to very warm, and the air was dry (I am comparing it to the 787 here, it's true). But, it was just so very uncomfortable that I cannot see myself using ANZ again. I had considered bidding on an upgrade, but I missed the deadline. When I walked past business class and saw the pods, I was glad I had missed it. They looked really small, cramped, and ""open"". However, as I have never actually flown business class (in 55 years of flying), I can only comment on my perception here. So, in short, I could have paid $250 more for American Airlines and had a much more comfortable trip, along with an extra bag.

The website leaves a large grey area of whether or not the food is safe for people with allergies as when it says peanut friendly they leave out all of the tree nuts used. Because I paid for “The Works” under the impression the meals were allergy-friendly I am disappointed in the customer service and lack of knowledge received by the flight attendants.",Negative,Negative,Negative,2019,auckland,NZ,sydney,AU,,False

IFE was excellent with an extensive ranges of films/TV shows, though whilst the seats were great for a short haul flight, they proved not so comfortable for a haul of 12 hours.

She just said you cant take the bag, you're too late, just take 7 kgs. I told her I was returning to Australia. Her attitude was brash, not helpful and she was not prepared to offer options for me after paying over $500 for the flight. She even smiled when she said sorry the bag can't go. In my mind, the bag could of been taken, thrown into the hold as people were still boarding, the plane had not turned on, the doors were still open. Kerikeri is a 'one horse airport' that if the lights turned out, there is nothing there. It has a plane come in 2 x in a day so extra service can be afforded. It is not like they are rushed off their feet.

The seats won't let you sit comfortably if you are taller than 5ft6''. There was a constant line for the toilets, which meant they weren't cleaned.

This is an excellent airline in the premium cabins. They are however woeful in economy on the trans-Tasman. As they only fly to the Gold Coast with narrow body aircraft there is no premium cabin and the best you can get is ‘Works Deluxe’. We had expiring Airpoints so decided to use them for this product. There is nothing deluxe about the economy experience. The meal was disgusting and not fit for human consumption. Not that they care. They just clear it away as though it’s nothing out of the ordinary that the food remains untouched. Beverages are served in tiny plastic cups that you can drink in two mouthfuls and you are continually requesting refills (complimentary alcohol on this fare class). The IFE is pitiful in content. Two crew members were obliging the others made you feel it was beneath them to lower themselves to serve you. Based on the flight I can see why this airline makes record profits - the inflight offerings are pathetic and would cost them very little.

Seat 2K is a window seat on the right side of the cabin. It is row two of the nine rows in Business Class on version 2 of ANZ’s 787-9. Three seats abreast herringbone configuration. The crew walks past this seat, over and over, delivering food and drinks to the seven rows of business class passengers behind it, as do passengers on their way to the business-class galley and restrooms. On my outbound flight to Auckland I sat in the last row of business class. It was a better, quieter, more private experience. Overhead storage for seat 2K, like all other window seats, is consumed by bedding. The first three rows of the center section have zero overhead storage (though the bedding can be stored behind those seats), so the passengers in the center seats must use the storage space that would have otherwise been available to passengers in the window seats. The fellow from the center seat had already filled the half of the bin that was not filled with bedding. Space is limited to begin with, and there is no usable underseat space. I pulled my mattress and pillow out of the overhead storage bin so that the fellow in the center seat and I could both stow our carry-ons. When the FA told me I couldn't put the mattress in the sizable, yawning cavity behind my seat, I told him he should try to find a space for it. So he took it away into the nether regions of the forward galley. As I sit here, my shoes are under the ottoman and there's a pillow and blanket on the floor where my feet are supposed to be. There's no armrest for my right arm. Crew is really nice in dealing with my, er, ""concern"" about the lack of storage space. Probably as exasperated about it as I. They are as pleasant, tactful, and as helpful as they can be. Really delightful people, dealing with what seem to be poor design features. They served champagne before departure, and that was nice. There's a little fold-out shelf behind my right arm and shoulder, but I don't know that it has any practical use. It is also lit, for some reason known only to Boeing and, presumably, ANZ. It's certainly not a place to put an empty champagne glass. The ANZ headphones are not good. I'd advise travelers to bring their own headphones. There's a jack to plug them into so that you can listen to the inflight entertainment, and both a USB charging port and a 110v outlet for your own devices. As I found on my previous long-haul ANZ flight on the same aircraft type, there appears to be a heat source under the seat. After a short time lying in the bed it becomes sweltering hot. I found the bed itself, under the mattress, to be warm. Very uncomfortable when used as a bed. The plane has large windows but they are behind you, so looking out of them requires turning your head more than 90 degrees. The view out the window would be better than the view of the feet and unclad legs of the person across the aisle, who's wearing shorts and went to bed shortly after takeoff, before dinner. Food is delicious and plentiful. Snacks are available any time. Overall, ANZ’s service is excellent, both on the ground and on the plane. The crew was marvelous. The aircraft is new and modern. But the seat layout and design, the lack of storage space both in the overhead and around the seat, and the temperature of the bed leaves much to be desired.

This was by far the worst flight experience with a Star Alliance Carrier so far, especially the cabin crew. We flew Premium Economy.

However we never experienced such a bad crew: - Safety: they did not show much concern for safety or did everything in a rush. When they prepared the cabin for landing they were in such a rush that they did not even check if we had our seatbelts on. One of the crew members was more busy looking outside the door window to look at the islands. Service: very bad, slow and unfriendly. - Entertainment: best part of the flight, although the volume of announcements during the flight (even safety related) were so low you almost could not hear them which maybe was the reason why we missed a welcome announcement of some sort. - Crew did not care for the passengers or to keep the cabin tidy. Not once in a 5 hour flight they cleaned up the rubbish or asked if we would like to have more drinks. We had to hold on to our used coffee cups and cans even during the landing because they did not prepare the cabin for landing. Towards the end of the flight they served a small breakfast when the pilot informed them to prepare cabin for landing which put them out of concept and put everyone in a rush.

The fact that I cant even buy a ticket for a friend or partner is also very poorly thought through. I bought a ticket for my partner as a surprise and had it emailed to me but now due to Air New Zealand taking it upon themselves to monitor Facebook sites like NZ flight swap, they flag down people on flights where there has been a swap or sale monitored, and flag down people, refusing to let them on the plane. At least let people who have paid for your service and bought this seat, give the ticket to someone, if they can't themselves make it or if it was a present. Monitoring these seats and not letting people on is in my opinion ridiculous. Why wouldn't you allow a service like a name change? Allowing us to pay a fee of perhaps $20 to change the name on the ticket so that you can still use the flight?

It is worth the USD 600 paid to have an empty middle seat, but the three seats are near useless as a lie-down bed for a normal size adult. For two adults side-by-side, it’s almost impossible. On two flights nobody on our plane tried to use SkyCouch as a bed. I suffer from chronic leg cramps and excruciating muscle spasms in my legs [if not stretched every hour or so]. Not to mention the possibility of pulmonary vein thrombosis in a 73-yr-old person such as myself. I did have one episode of a terrible muscle spasm, which necessitated me having to unbuckle my seat belt and stand up to put weight on my leg to relieve the spasm. Luckily, the flight was smooth at the time and no flight attendant had to order me to sit down [without regard to the severe pain that would cause me]. However, as I was stretching my leg and walking to a restroom, an attendant told me I needed to return to my seat when the captain activated the fasten seat belt sign. I’m a veteran traveler and know it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion with a flight attendant following airline rules and guidelines and will not or cannot make exceptions no matter how much pain and discomfort a passenger might endure. Nonetheless, I did take a moment to explain my difficult situation to the young stewardess, who probably could not imagine my 73-yr-old condition. Of course, she showed no sensitivity or understanding whatsoever, and told me - in a tone which indicated she thought I may have been senile - that I might bump my head in rough air if I were not seated and secured with a fastened seat belt. The fact that may have caused me excruciating pain did not register at all with her. She could have cared less. In such a situation the risk to my safety and good health was far worse if I were seated and buckled-in than if I were allowed to stand for a few minutes until the spasm passed and the pain lessened. I doubt that this review will result in a more tolerant and enlightened approach by ANZ [or any other alrilnes’ flight attendants], but I hope this description of my situation on NZ28 [departure from AKL on Feb 23] might result in attendants having a more open-minded approach to dealing with a passenger’s medical issue.

Air New Zealand has a serious problem with the online booking in that it limits the number of characters of the name to 28. They say it is a legal requirement of international aviation, which I know is not the case as I book online and travel internationally with many different airlines, and no other airline limits the length of the name! This problem has caused hours of head-ache for myself and everyone in my extended family and I’m sure other people with long names. I have sent emails to the 'top’ of Air NZ and no-one is listening. They keep repeating the same old story about 'it's a legal requirement to limit the name to 28 characters’. Sadly I made the mistake of booking a flight again this May with Air New Zealand flying co-share on Singapore Airlines, but I'm told by Singapore Airlines they cannot issue a ticket and cannot guarantee that I can board the flight, because my name is not correct! I've called Air New Zealand 3 times with very long phone queues at $1 a minute from Cuba where I live and they say they can't do anything about it. The computer won't allow them to add all the letters in my passport! So now I am left with a ticket on Singapore Airlines that I don’t know I can use on the day of the flight, because Air New Zealand prejudices against people with long names under the premise that it is aviation law.

Secondly, they went and changed our already selected seat assignments which were two aisle seats to an aisle and a center seat. Thirdly, these seats are by far the most uncomfortable seats on any aircraft that I've flown for more than an hour. The seats are so tight that it's a joke, also the leg room is almost non-existent. The seating on Ryanair that I flew a while back was vastly superior. In addition to the above, I was totally unable to eat the meal they provided as the seat back of the person in front of you restricts access to it, that was probably a blessing for me as the meal looked as though it would not be good for you.

You still get a decent amount of free water, tea and coffee on the flight and can make use of the non-movie part of the IFE, in particular their great music selection. One further downside of the two most basic fare options is that Air NZ requires you to pay for choosing your seat even at check-in, which gives the experience a low-cost feel. If you do not pay, the system chooses a seat for you. The seat pitch on the B777 was decent, the pitch on the A320 very tight for a 3 1/2 hours flight.

The aisle narrowness also proved a problem later when I tried to sleep (I am a thin lady and don't spill over seat sides) and I was constantly banged into by crew and passengers going down the aisle. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable, the premium seats have a leg rest below the seat that lifts up and provides no comfort other than take away more space and leg room. These seats would only work if there are two family members of small stature seated in the three seat row by themselves otherwise they are useless.

I do not expect the service and amenities to be the same now as then but am disappointed on how bare-bones they are now. For instance: on a 14+ hour flight from Auckland to Houston there is no snack, beverage or even water served until the meal about two hours into the flight. I know snacks are not about nourishment but to alleviate boredom and make it seem as though something is happening. I can't verify it but I'm sure the meal trays are shrinking. Dinner, while usually good, was appalling. Some sort of mystery chicken chunks with a spicy sauce and rice. Breakfast (I chose the fruit option) was only one muffin, one container of yoghurt and a measly fruit plate including—in the height of the USA's growing season—two slices of canned peaches! That was it as far as food went. I did go to the galley to get a cookie in the night. During the long night a flight attendant came by with water only once. I have restless legs and don't sleep for more than an hour or two at a time and even then very lightly so it wasn't that I missed the water coming around. That was okay with me though as I brought my own 2 liters of water as I won't drink water stored in tanks on aircraft's.

They had lots of different snacks in the galley during the night, not just small Cookie Time cookies and some sort of chips.

It was a small 2:2 domestic flight (around 1 hour air time) leaving on a clear night however cancelled without notice. When I asked the ticket staff they were unable to give me a reason as to why the flight was cancelled. This is purely theory however It is likely that they cancelled the earlier flight due to the fact that the passengers of my original flight and of the one I ended up taking could have fit in one plane. Although this is a smart business decision (cutting costs for the same gain) it is a betrayal of customer trust and time. Not only was I not given a reson for the cancel but was too given no notification of it until reaching the airport.

Having flown to the US a few times with Air New Zealand, it is unfortunate to see that their standards have slipped and service is inconsistent. Overall the experience in Business Premier was acceptable considering the special price I booked. I used to recommend the airline but I would be less enthusiastic to recommend Air NZ if paying full price for Business or if flying in economy. The check-in at Sydney Airport was absolutely appalling, the whole experience took 40 minutes and after waiting 15 minutes in the priority line I was rudely told to go back to the automatic check-in machines, despite other passengers in the business check-in being served at the counter. The check-in machines didn't work properly (which is why I went straight to the counter), so a staff member had to be located to do it for me, then I had to drag the bags back to the check-in counter to stand in line again for another 15 minutes at least. I understand this is the process when flying in economy, but this fell so short of the mark for business it wasn't funny, and the different treatment for other (older) customers was insulting. When I did eventually manage to get to the lounge in Sydney, the barista service was nice, I was able to find a seat and the choice of food was good. However I preferred the vastly superior views at the old lounge (before they renovated about 3 years ago I think). The Business Premier seats on the 777s are comfortable and I find the bed excellent. The meal service overall was fine. I prefer to dine in the lounge instead and only eat lightly on the flight. I recommend taking the Peter Gordon dining options where offered, or having the cold appetizer or soup (which they always seem to have) as those are the most reliable. The breakfast smoothies are also consistently excellent. I had waffles for breakfast and that was also good. On the return flight from San Francisco to Auckland, I found the menu options a bit unappetizing. Usually I have the fast dine option, but it was a creamy cauliflower soup which is not what I wanted, so I ended up with three courses of a cold Gazpacho soup (good), chicken main (average) and lemon shortcake dessert (average). The hot breakfast options were eggs or pancakes which I didn't bother with, I just had the continental breakfast of a smoothie then fruit and yoghurt, all of which was fine. Having taken this route with Air NZ a few times both on the old 747s and the 777s, unfortunately it is noticeable how much noisier the 777s are. Even with noise cancelling headphones, the noise was annoying on the return flight and it reduced my sleep time. The 300s are marginally quieter than the 200s but compared to being at the front of a 747 or an A380s it is loud. If you are flying to LA the 787s would be great, but the San Francisco flights are on 777s. Air NZ use the Singapore Airlines lounge at SFO. I understand it's the best of an average bunch and the only one with airside showers apart from United First. Food options in the lounge were quite good. If you want to use the showers, make sure you get in quick as they had a total of four towels and couldn't be bothered to get any in until the next Singapore flight after the Air NZ one had left, very poor service. I had to buy a towel at the airport as a result. You also have to ask them to unlock the showers, what a pain.

But, this is when another disadvantage of this close racked seating became more apparent, the unpleasant smells vented by nearby passengers had you reaching for the air ventilation nozzle, unfortunately this does not exist on the 787. The food was probably down with the worst we have experienced, but the cabin staff did their best to offset this by plying passengers with booze, it seemed their mantra was a drunk passenger was a happy passenger.

I tried 'vietnamese cuisine' but it was really not vietnamese as the food was greasy and full of weird spices. This was my first time using Air New Zealand on an international flight and this has been a complete let down and my expectations of a high quality airline that they heavily invested in their PR to build the image has been destroyed.

I am a Kiwi expat, have lived in London for 17 years and have used Air New Zealand many times over the years when returning to NZ to see family. I have to say that gradually, over time, I believe the airline has fallen into the trap of believing its own PR. The first thing you hear when you get on a flight these days is about the latest award the airline has won. While there have been upgrades over the years to the fleet, in-flight entertainment and recently check-in procedures (more on this later), the personal touch and focus on service that made the airline stand out, are no longer as obvious and seem to be replaced with a slightly superior cockiness that is not that attractive. Over recent flights Air New Zealand have dropped a brand new solid suitcase on its corner, stoving it in. When I complained (which was extremely time consuming and difficult), I was told the suitcase still works fine so Air New Zealand were not going to offer anything by way of remediation. Lost our luggage between Auckland and Wellington (via the high tech new check-in procedure). When I registered concern on the return flight I was told by a cocky attendant that Air New Zealand doesn't lose luggage so I must have been on another airline!). Ironically when we registered our lost luggage we were in a not insignificant queue and the ground staff gave the impression that this was a very frequent event. On my last trip, 4 out of 6 flights on the return journey from London to Wellington were late, one of which arrived very late in Auckland which required a group of transferring passengers to run from domestic to international to make the next flight. This caused stress and anxiety. While I am sure Air New Zealand would say that some of the causal factors are out of its control, I think it is the general air of disinterest mixed with self congratulatory arrogance that puts me off the most. Will I continue to use Air New Zealand - well possibly because the network of flights to and from the UK is generally very convenient in terms of door to door elapsed travel time.

Awful (non-existent) food and drinks. You can preselect seats. Anything in front is ""preferred seats"" and it is very difficult for those with Seats Only or Seats + Bags option to purchase them. Preferred seats are $10 one way and standard seats $5. You have to pay a surcharge if booked via cards. Check in is always done by automated kiosks with no exceptions allowed. You will require assistance if you are non-machine literate or not conversant in using English. I noticed large tour group from China required a Chinese-speaking staff to press the kiosk screens to check in for them. Then you drop the bag onto the continuously running conveyor belt yourself, with poorly designed ergonomics. Also it doesn't matter if you are elite or Koru Club members - you still drop the bags yourself. There are still agents at the gate (for the time being). Boarding is done through rows in order. Often if you are sitting at rows 16 or over you are required to exit the airbridge halfway, climb down stairs walk over the tarmac and reboard via stairs at the rear door. The seats are standard, with pitch left to the bare minimum. They are often rather dirty as well. Safety demonstration is by videos. It is often slick marketing that does not really impart information easily enough to passengers especially non-English speaking ones. Inflight you are offered a cookie or crisp with only tea, coffee, or mineral water. No meals or hot snacks are available. If you fly during Koru Hours (before 8 am and 4:30 pm to 7 pm) you get cheese and crackers instead of cookies and crisps and beer and wine are available as additional options. Breakfast fare is muffins. Staff are friendly - which is the only redeeming feature. Almost all flights between Christchurch and Wellington use the ATR-72 these days which means you walk in the rain on the tarmac on wet days, plus greater chance of weather-related delays, and reduced comfort level due to narrower seats and much smaller overhead lockers. The rationale is to offer ""hourly service given the current level of demand"". This is a defacto hybrid carrier - not really a full service unlike Cathay Pacific or even Qantas. Decision-makers listen to what some business travellers (not all) want, yet they ended up making a the majority unhappy. Overall, I will pick Air New Zealand for domestic flights just because they are the only airline offering reasonable schedules.

To me, this would be fine on a short flight (1-2 hours) on a budget carrier, but not on flights exceeding 4 hours. I opted to pay $10 for all movies in the end, but was pretty disappointed to find that the film I watched had been heavily censored and there were constant interruptions every time an announcement was made (usually about food, or welcoming platinum members etc) and including annoying messages popping up on the screen during films and games. The check in at Auckland the next day was a disaster. Unless you were a business / premium passenger, you are forced to spend ages trying to use their automated check in machines that are very complicated and frustrating, then have to use another even more complicated machine to drop bags off. In both cases, we needed help from 3 members of staff.  The ground staff were helpful and the cabin crews, although not particularly warm, did their job. Air New Zealand have a fleet of modern aircraft and the 2 Boeing 777 aircraft that we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. At this stage, I will avoid Air New Zealand if travelling to or through New Zealand again.

There’s no menu card or indication of what meals and drink service is offered. As one of the cabin crew grumpily instructed the passenger next to us, you have to use the online screen to order a drink. Having figured it out I ordered two drinks and some vege chips (the only food item besides a pre-packed cookie available without paying for it).

The aisles are too narrow for anyone to walk down without bopping those in aisle seats-like me. Other aspects of the seat (pitch, width, recline) were fine. Flight crew were excellent, food was good. IFE is improving, but still not as up-to-date as many other internationally focused carriers.

The Works offering : A320 fitted with PTVs and flight arrived early in to Auckland (flight only 1.55 hours, nominally 2.40h flight). However, no webcheck available for this code share. Stressed cabin crew, crumbs on seat, rushed unintelligible announcements (no bilingual crew). Had to suffer the All Blacks 'Men in Black' inspired safety video and crowing how Air Air New Zealand is a multi-award winning airline, including 2015 Airline of the Year - (not Skytrax, but some unheard of airline rating). Lunch served straight after take off. Food options were a chicken salad or a lamb casserole. The lamb casserole was an abomination.  Swimming in lanolin. Accompanied by a bread roll to soak up the fat and a shrink-wrapped industrial cake slice for dessert. One glass of red wine offered (no refills offered to passengers,) and no tea/coffee service offered. Crew still found time to disappear for approx.40 minutes, reappearing for descent. And still no tea or coffee offered. Contrast this to my AirCalin operated flight which was as near perfect a shorthaul flight as one could wish for. My partner is top tier FF with Air NZ and I have a partner card entitling me to perks such as additional baggage, lounge access, priority boarding, premium check in. Still chose AirCalin over Air New Zealand for this trip as the AirCalin  full service tickets are cheaper for a far superior inflight product.

When entering the aircraft, all overhead lockers closed and no Flight Attendant to assist. Went to the rear galley to find two staff, who advised no place to stow our cabin bags. Just ignored me then after several minutes one said I will stow it. Went to my seat. My wife had hers in her lap. 10 minutes later another attendant comes though with my bag asking who left the bag? I advised the other attendant said she would stow it. He then went off to find the original attendant and she stowed in in another locker away from mine. After dinner was served, just at our row ran out of wine and left with the cart to get some more. Then came back and went past us? Ten minutes later the attendant notices my wife and I as well as the window seat without a drink with our dinner, and asks did we forget you? Took our drink orders and then came back. By this time I was done with dinner. Cabin crew through the whole flight were just going through the motions. Not many smiles, or friendliness. When leaving the aircraft at AKL I handed my Air NZ Air Points Card to the attendant who gave us such poor service and said give this to the Flight Manager and advise that you have lost a customer as your service stinks. Upon arrival at AKL at 0555, at baggage claim they announce apologies will be a delay getting the bags off the plane. Twenty five minutes later they came. By then several other flights arrived and the Customs Hall looked like a mini version of LAX. By the time we got through and took the shuttle bus to the AIR NZ Domestic Terminal we missed our connecting slight to Dunedin that morning. The Air New Zealand counters were full of other delayed passengers. The first Air New Zealand agent tried to assist and said we have to wait until 6:05pm that night for a flight. Over ten hours wait! No compensation, hotel, etc. She then could not get us booked on the computer and ran away for assistance somewhere. 20 minutes later came back and advised another agent would come and help us and left. After waiting around thirty minutes I lined up and got to meet the Supervisor to advise her it looked like we had been abandoned? She apologised and booked us on the flight that night and gave us $18.00 of food vouchers for the two of us, for our 10.5 hour wait on the leather covered benches in the Air New Zealand  Domestic Terminal.",Negative,Negative,Negative,2015,sfo,US,akl,NZ,,False

We had to checkout through customs and get our suitcases back. After about 2 hours of waiting one of the staff members announced that the closest accommodation available was 1.5 drive away, this was because it was Bledisloe Cup night in Sydney. They also said another option was that they would make arrangements for us to rest/sleep at the airport. We thought that by the time we drive to the accommodation and settle the kids down to sleep then it wouldn’t be long before we had to wake up and get organized and drive back to the airport. We decided to stay at the airport as it was now midnight and our young kids (and us) just wanted to sleep. When we arrived at the ‘area’ which Air NZ said they would make available for us we just couldn’t believe it. We had be taken to one of the airports main entrances with hardfloor tiles and we were crammed in with 200 other people. It was like a bad dream. It was a very long/cold horrible night. Finally the time came to check-in again and we went through customs. We had Duty Free bottles with us from the previous days check-in. At the customs 'bag screening' we were kindly told that Air NZ should not have neglected in telling us that our Duty Free bottles should have been packed in our checked-in luggage before re-entering customs again. They confiscated our Duty Free, took a copy of one of our boarding passes and encouraged us to go and see the Duty Manager of Air NZ and they would sort it for us. We did this and the Air NZ staff were very understanding of our situation and said they would arrange to go and pick up the Duty Free from customs and get it on our flight. When we were boarding the plane to Raro the Duty Manager approached us and totally confirmed that our Duty Free was sorted and we can pick it up at the Fragile Luggage area at Raro Airport. When we arrived at Rarotonga unfortunately our Duty Free hadn’t made it on the plane at all. The lovely staff at Rarotonga made notes and said she would contact Air NZ in Sydney for us. The next day we got a phonecall and apparently our Duty Free was still sitting in Sydney airport waiting for someone from Air NZ to go and pick it up and put it on a plane to Rarotonga. After many enquiries from us it never turned up at Rarotonga which was disappointing.  Air NZ staff were always very polite however it was the lack of 'follow-through' and unfullfillled expectations on Air NZ’s part which we feel extremely let down by.",Positive,Positive,Negative,2015,sydney,AU,rartonga,,,False

The space seats were great for the kids to sleep in. Maybe they could recline a bit more but on the whole they were great. Our return flight from Los Angeles was okay, but when we arrived in Auckland they did not have out stroller waiting for us. After a lot of confusion we were told it had been put in the cargo hold and was being transferred to our flight to Australia.
