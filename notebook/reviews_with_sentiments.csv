My ordeal began with an extended delay at the airport that quickly turned into an overnight stay, largely due to the airline's lack of communication and support. Initially, our flight was delayed, and after waiting for about four hours, it was eventually canceled. Throughout this period, there was minimal information provided about the situation, leaving passengers confused and frustrated. To add to the inconvenience, the airline offered no immediate assistance in rebooking our flight, which only compounded the stress of the situation. While Air New Zealand did provide hotel and meal vouchers, the experience with these compensations was far from satisfactory. The hotel we were directed to did not accept the vouchers due to delays in payment processing by the airline. This left us scrambling for alternative accommodations and additional expenses. The next leg of our journey was similarly marred by issues. The second flight was delayed again, this time due to a broken plane. The airline had to find a new aircraft and transfer catering, further prolonging our travel experience and adding to the frustration. One of the most frustrating aspects of this ordeal has been the difficulty in resolving the financial implications of the delays. Efforts to seek reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses on hotels and meals were met with a series of excuses, slow responses, and an overall lack of effective communication. Reaching a customer service representative was challenging, and when contact was made, responses were often unhelpful and evasive. Overall, my experience with Air New Zealand was far from satisfactory. The combination of poor communication, inadequate support, and slow reimbursement processes has left a lasting negative impression. For anyone considering flying with Air New Zealand, I recommend being prepared for potential disruptions and ensuring you have a contingency plan in place.",Negative,Negative,Neutral,2024

Air New Zealand has to be the worst in condescending service and unnecessary process. I’m writing this review after 5 flights with them in the last 10 days (and unfortunately another 3 to go). The boarding process is peculiar with word choices such as “you can board when invited”. To be clear I wait till I’m called and don’t understand the notion of people jumping queues. But the word choice of invite is the first passive aggressive experience as part of the flight experience A week ago I flew Air NZ and for the first time in my life I was reprimanded by the hostess for not watching (I was listening) the in flight safety. I told her I’m listening and she said “well you should watch” Checking in today my bag was 32.7kg. I appreciate there needs to be a limit, but there’s no discretion. I’m flying business class for a three week trip. I then removed a few items and the scale said 32.0kg. I was then told it has to be under 32 which necessitated me to refute that point. Grudgingly, the person then put the case through and gave me the *sigh* treatment. Getting onto the flight, the first thing the host says is the incoming flight’s passengers “ was a 9 out of 10, so you have a high standard to live up to”. Whilst I 100% understand this was meant in humour, it’s symptomatic of an airline that doesn’t want to serve. These experiences alongside poor food on the flights, no pyjamas on overnight business and frankly the weirdest business class layout with no privacy makes this an airline to avoid. Unless of course you want to feel like you’re being done a favour for something you paid for. It’s relatively good value for money (at prices that are still stubbornly high) but you need to take into consideration the places they skimp on.

We PAID extra as he was an unaccompanied minor - Harlan Pere. Hes 11 [his brother was travelling with him but he is 13]. Checked in for the flight at special assistance as normal. Flight was slightly delayed. Then flight was called. Lined the boys up in the line but was very surprised as all their previous flights - [a couple of times a year for the last several years] unaccompanied minors have been called first. EVERY SINGLE TIME! When the boys got to the gate and swiped their boarding passes, that's when the gate agent realised there was a minor on the flight. Kelly, the most unprofessional, rude and disgustingly inept gate agent I have ever met, then decided the boys needed to stand to the side and be boarded last. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE! When we queried why they weren't called first Kelly informed me that Air NZ never calls for unaccompanied minors before a flight and she had never done this in her 8 years working there. THIS IS A LIE! When I asked to speak to a supervisor she said she was the supervisor. When I asked for someone higher up to make a complaint Kelly told me she was the highest person. When I asked for the name of her supervisor so I could make a complaint she refused to give me this information as well as her last name. All of this was getting very loud - she was just as loud, and I had to tell her several times to listen to what I was saying and not talk over me. At this stage there is approx 200 people in the AIR NZ departure lounge listening to this heated discussion. As well as the boys who were confused why there were being held back. No one explained it to them from Air NZ. I went back to the Special assistance desk and they pointed me to the Premium check in desk and I spoke to Marianne - Team Manager - who listened and confirmed that Kellys behaviour, attitude and customer service was abysmal. Several people I don't know came up to me after and said it was shocking and I should complain about Kelly and her incompetent service. Mariana did her best to listen but Kelly is disgraceful. I have paid extra for this service, been lied to, been yelled at, been dismissed and made to feel like we were the issue as we didnt bring him up sooner when we were never informed by Special Assistance this was now a requirement. If the policy has changed [which Mariana confirmed hadn't] or Kelly didn't pick up there were unaccompanied Minors on the flight all she had to do was apologise and say a mistake was made. Not flat out argue and lie in front of 200 people that she was right and MINORS HAVE NEVER BEEN called in her 8 years doing the job.",Positive,Negative,Negative,2024

I certainly will not fly them again - my experience was so poor that I will go so far as to change my travel plans to avoid flying with them. My first concern is the nickel and diming that this greedy airline does for its customer. In fact, I say Air New Zealand is worse than Spirit Airline in this regard. Your ticket gets you a seat only - you need to pay extra for a suitcase, a seat to ensure you and anyone you are traveling with can sit together (yes, they will separate you even if you purchase tickets together), and changes (even if the other flight has open seats). My second concern is the abysmal customer service. Gate agents are unable to help and require you to leave security for any and all questions. My gate agent was lovely enough to yell at me that she would not be able to help me before I even asked my question (I wish I was exaggerating). My experience with the help desk was worse. I waited for 10 minutes as two free agents refused to help the line. I also had two separate agents help men before me who walked up to the desk after those of us in line had already been waiting 10+ minutes. When I did finally get them to be willing to help me, they refused to answer my question of how much it would cost to switch flights to an earlier one. Their response was a condescending, “too much, hun. Your flight is only in two hours. Why don’t you just wait?” My third complaint is the lack of respect to inform customers of delays in a timely manner. My flight was supposed to board at 1:40 pm. At 1:35 pm, we were informed that the previously flight was arriving late and we would be delayed by an hour. Note, they had also known about this for at least 45 minutes, but refused to share the information.",Negative,Positive,Negative,2023

I spoke to an Air New Zealand customer service agent (after being on hold for 2 hours.) I explained the situation. The agent checked with her supervisor and relayed to me the bad news that I would not get a refund (tickets cost $170). I was told I could change the flight dates with a change flight fee of $64.72 for the two tickets, but I had to pick now the new fly date. Furthermore, she said I couldn't book past January 2024.

The flight was a fully flexible ""The Works"" ticket with insurance for a short 3 hour flight cost me in excess of 1200 dollars AUD. As a Kiwi returning home for Christmas, I decided to take Air New Zealand after the last international experience I had with them went sour but thinking maybe it was a one-off and to give them another go. I majorly regret giving them the benefit of the doubt. Firstly our flight was cancelled for ""operational reasons"". When the customers quizzed the ground staff they outright lied to us and said a weather event had forced the flight to be cancelled (What they didn't count on was one of the passengers being a travel agent who quickly called the girls at their contact centre and found out they lied). Absolutely no coordination from the ground crew, just told to stand by until the Air NZ contact centre rebooked us or go back to our hotels etc. I had just driven 3 days from Alice Springs across Australia to essentially be lied to and then told to go away. Most of us were rebooked for flights around half an hour later well after Christmas, some not getting home until as late as New Years Eve on rebookings. Widespread disappointment and they frankly did an awful job managing the fallout, especially for an Air NZ crew. Spoke to the travel agent passenger and she had cleverly managed to get herself onto a diversion flight to the Gold Coast before connecting with another Air NZ flight to NZ just in time for Christmas. All at no additional cost as per their legal requirements to make alternative plans for you if fair and reasonable etc. I call the call centre to try to make this arrangement also (given The Works ticket I have), get told that they can do this but I have to PAY for myself to get to the Gold Coast. I confront the staff on the front desk at the airport about this and they sheepishly ignore me, I confirm with the travel agent passenger again if she had to pay and was I entitled to do so like her? She confirms no she didn't have to pay and yes I was entitled to this. I put the questions to them assertively and they attempt to objection handle me (I seriously hate when customer service reps treat customers like their heads are filled with rocks). I speak to a woman from SwissPort who is standing next to them watching all this going on and she very kindly intervenes, confirms what I've been told by the travel agent passenger is the truth, gets me onto a Virgin flight within a matter of less than 60 seconds and the Air NZ crew sheepishly pretend they didn't just shaft me and that someone else from a different organisation actually fixed the issue. Pathetic. But I find a last-minute airport motel room and call it a day. The next day, I head to the Gold Coast. When I land, my bags go missing despite them supposed to be transferred through and waiting with Air NZ for loading. Fortunately, a kind soul from Air NZ actually assisted me with this but arguably it shouldn't happen. Lastly, while the cabin crew on the flight were very nice I got no hot meal.

It was a direct flight from Auckland to Tokyo. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. The ground staff I encountered was unfriendly and unhelpful to say the least. The ground staff member did not listen to my answers, so I had to repeat my final destination three times. Then she kept asking me for the Japanese resident card although I told her twice that I was a Japanese citizen travelling with a Japanese passport, which she was already holding. I asked for an aisle seat, and she never responded to my request. I was assigned seat 63K, a window seat in the last row of the plane. That caused inconvenience not just for me, but for the family who was sitting next to me and travelling with young children. As I was at the airport three hours before the departure and there was no online check-in, I find it difficult to believe that there were no aisle seats available at the time of my check-in. I understand the planes can be full and not all customers' requests can be met, but that should be communicated. I still do not know whether the staff member who ""assisted"" with my check-in did not hear my request, was not able to fulfil it or simply chose to ignore it. I travel often and I have been through many airports and check-in counters. I rarely encountered staff that was as unfriendly and unhelpful as the staff that I encountered at the Air New Zealand encounter on January 6, 2023. In-flight service also needs improvement. The meals were basic and repetitive. Fudge brownie was served three times during the 10-hour flight? There was no amenity kit that is standard on most international flights. The movie selection was also poor. In addition, the crew did not seem to pay attention to the passengers. When drinks were served between the meals (which happened rarely), the crew seemed to notice only the passengers seating in the aisle seats. My general impression was that they did not seem to recognise that they were there to serve the customers.

But these delays and rescheduling have been beyond of the joke now and I will be making a point of flying with a different airline from now on and I recommend if you want quality service that you don't fly with Air New Zealand anymore. The problem with Air New Zealand is their attitude with their constant rescheduling and cancellations, they don't care. If I ran my business like Air New Zealand does I would be out of business as they don't care about the customer and the upheaval they create on each flight. Prime example is my last flight (and almost every flight) I finally get 3 days away from work to fly away and again a last minute cancellation which I had to rebook and we loss 1 day of our 3 day holiday ... this doesn't sound like a big deal but since lock downs this was our first weekend off and since I work 7 days a week this was a holiday I was really looking forward to it. Then on the way home another rescheduling by Air New Zealand. If you ring up to complain, expect over 1 hour (I gave up after 1 1/2hrs) on hold. I love supporting kiwi companies, but enough is enough and i recommend if you can book with another airline - unless you enjoy long waits in airports, losing room bookings, last minute scrambling to reschedule flights, car rentals and appointments.

My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated. I hope to never have to deal with this airline ever again, and I am not looking forward to flying with them for my mandatory trip to get rid of my points that I cannot get back.",Positive,Negative,Negative,2022

The answer from Air New Zealand is a big NO! All my attempts at contacting the airline on the travel day went into a black hole. I tried calling their call centre during office hour and was put on hold for more than one hour without any answer. I tried emailing them and sending them Facebook messages. Neither produced any response. I only got a short reply on Facebook two days after my original travel day, telling me that they cannot offer any refund.  I was sold a product that I cannot use and was not told about it, and it was my fault? Ever since then, the airline has ignored all my requests for refund.

Brand new aircraft with superb Cabin Crew, just like the flights on former TE from many years ago. Crew probably very happy to be working again, but this is how passengers expect a flight to be, even with lower fares. Aircraft was slightly less than half full, thus plenty of space for the 3 hour plus flight. The staff were so friendly and being an inaugural flight, sparkling wine was flowing freely. Comfortable seats with great video screens which were simple to use. I particularly liked the screen based ordering for drinks and food: Very professional and easy. (The return flight was a little different!). Flight only a few minutes late on arrival, no problem there. Return flight NZ197, 29 April 2021. Older A320, but also with same video screen. Crew were a little less friendly, but very pleasant nonetheless. I ordered and paid for a drink by card (brilliant!). Later an announcement was made that the service was soon closing. I ordered another drink and paid, but this time, it was not delivered to me. I'm not sure if another passenger received a free drink, or whether the aircraft system failed between the time of my order and the service closing. I have pursued this with the airline, and I am waiting on a response from them. Sadly, the return flight was almost empty. There were approximately 30 to 35 passengers on the flight, in an aircraft which seats about 180 passengers. The amount of space was enjoyable, but this does not bode well for a permanent flight on this sector. An Airline needs to make a profit, and I am hoping that passenger numbers will increase. People in New Zealand suggested that it was a little early for this flight to start due to the Corona Virus. Perhaps. I love to fly and I felt perfectly safe. Maybe I was lucky and avoided any health problems, but the precautions were strict and effective in my opinion. I will use this flight again.

I had a connected flight booked to Sydney and received an email changing the time only one week after booking. Ten days after this, a week before I was due to fly, I received a second email confirming the time changes from the first, however Air New Zealand had also discreetly changed the date to 3 weeks later, while maintaining the exact same time. I noticed the change two days prior to flying and called the airline in a panic. After being kept on hold, I spoke to a robot like woman who did not once apologise for a) their emails being incorrect b) the fact they had changed the flight dates at all. She provided no solutions, and no reimbursements. There was no way for my to get to Sydney, so in the end I had to pay £800 extra to book a Singapore Airlines operated by Air NZ flight home direct from Auckland. I missed my flight from Sydney to London, the cost of which I have to refrain myself from thinking about as it makes my heart race every time. The customer service was unhelpful - tried to put me on hold, push me to speak to another team, got the dates for the day I wanted to fly which then meant an increase of prices, and incorrectly hold me the price I had eventually forked out also included an extra bag. At the airport that 24kg extra bag was going to cost me $500 on account of Air NZ having a ridiculous fee of $250 per 23kg. If you exceed this there is no oversized fee, but you have to pay for an additional bag. In the end, as I was flying through Singapore Airlines operated by Air NZ the very kind gentleman at the counter (who was on the phone to Air NZ getting rates) took pity on me and wavered the fee. He apologised for Air NZ, and said in times like this when we're all just desperate to get home we need to be kind. That's the attitude I would expect of New Zealand national airline. I will never fly Air NZ ever again. The service I received was worse than budget airlines such as Easy Jet and Ryanair who I always expect to be trying to take my money at every turn.

This one supposed to be cheaper if we would have payed online, but as the flight has a connection from LA to Houston with United Airlines, we couldn’t do it online. When we called, the customer service attendant told us that the extra bag is going to be 250NZD plus 160NZD of the heavy charge. We didn’t thought that this total payment will be 500NZD in total. They charged 250NZD because of the extra bag and 250NZD because the latter was 32kg. If we had known this, we would have pay 2 extra bag of 250NZD.

Our trouble first started at LAX when we had received our confirmation email and tickets we noticed that my husband and I had not been seated next to each other, but they told us (in the email) that if we paid an extra 100 dollars each we could pick seats next to each other. So when we arrived at LAX via SeaTac we went to look for a customer service agent. There were no customer service agents so we tried to talk to someone at the gate of a flight leaving earlier than ours. We also tried to ask if there was any room on the earlier flight because we’ve been moved multiple times to earlier same day flights by QANTAS for more convenience. The woman said “if you wanted to change your flight you should have contacted reservations via phone” and then immediately looked behind us and yelled “NEXT” without us even saying another word. So we waited for someone to come to our gate and when they finally arrived we walked up to change our seats. He called someone via phone to change our seats and then said “yeah for some reason they want to sit next to each other” very rudely. Believe it or not I would like to sit next to my husband on a 13 hour flight. He then proceeded to scan our passports (our final destination was Australia where my husband is from) and told me my visa to Australia had been denied. I told him I had a confirmation email that it was approved and gave him the confirmation number. He proceeded to call Australian immigration to figure out what was going on. After he had scanned my passport the first time my husband walked around the desk so he could see the computer screen. The man proceeded to scan my passport at least 15 more times and told me it showed up denied every time, but my husband could see the computer was popping up that my visas were approved. He took thirty minutes to call immigration and finally tell me nothing was wrong with my visa. While we were on the flight you could tell none of the flight attendants cared about anyone on the flight. One of them spilled orange juice all over my husband, he shrugged and then walked off without an apology or giving us a napkin to clean up. Later one of the flight attendants slapped my leg as they walked past for no apparent reason. Lastly I went to the bathroom and as I got out and started walking back to my seat I noticed one of the attendants walking down the same aisle so I started to back up towards the bathroom so he could go by rather than trying to shuffle past each other and as he got closer to me he made a shooing motion and said “GO, GO” and then sat in the back to gossip with all the other flight attendants that were sitting back there. I emailed customer service about all of this and was told I would be contacted in 15-20 days and it has now been almost 4 weeks since I submitted my complaint.

Disappointing change for the worst. The decision to change marketing of your seats/tickets on the basis of seat cost and separate extra charges for food, drinks, and entertainment is appalling. Only the discount airlines such as Jetstar and virgin employ this type of ticketing and are transparent about it. Obviously, Air New Zealand has lost its image as a premium airline to resort to this type of non transparent marketing. This situation was highlighted when we travelled over Christmas 2019, when four of our Family members visited Australia. We were very disappointed with the flight and service. We were not made aware of the extras required when booking our flights and therefore had no food, drinks and entertainment as expected. After paying $700 plus each we expected full service, not just a seat. On his separate return flight to NZ, my Brother experienced a terrible and uncomfortable flight with no cabin air conditioning. When he asked flight staff about the situation, they were uncaring and unfriendly. The baggage check in policy has also changed, and is so unfair, as each passenger is allowed 1x23kg bag. Two of us had one (1) bag each and my 9 year old Daughter had two (2) small bags with a combined weight of 17kg - well below the allowable 23kg. Total combined weight of all check in baggage was 64kg - below the allowable 69kg. No consideration or attempt was made to assist only a demand to pay a $160 fee. Air New Zealand staff Immediately demanded payment of $160 for this situation, and then an additional $160 as one of the other bags was 1.6kg overweight. Your staff were unfriendly, arrogant, and not prepared to offer any solution until one of the  male staff members came to our rescue and was willing to help with our problem. Other reputable airlines do not treat check in baggage in this way. They are prepared to look at the situation make allowances using combined weight if there is a problem. Based on our experience, we will fly Qantas in future, not Air New Zealand. We have used the discount airlines such as Jetstar and Virgin Pacific in the past and had a far better experience and paid a lot less for the flight.",Negative,Negative,Negative,2020

I haven't flown Air New Zealand since 2011, and I was looking forward to using them again. I had only ever had good experiences with this airline, and expected no different this time. Perhaps I was spoiled the last time I few to NZ because I traveled on American Airlines' B787, and it was a pleasant experience. But then, I have also traveled on Air New Zealand's 777 before, and enjoyed that, so I really don't know what has changed. However, the fact is, my well-seasoned (25+ years) rolling carry on would not fit down the aisle once I got to steerage, and I was forced to turn it sideways and lift it. It wasn't that I couldn't make it fit, but I had to slightly angle it each time I went past a seat. This probably should have been a warning sign! My seat was uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that my left buttock became positively painful. Not sore, painful. It felt like I was sitting on some kind of ridge. The seat was hard, and I suffered cramps for 24 hours after landing as a result. Although I was lucky enough to have a free seat next to me (the plane was full), the shape of the seats made it such that it really wasn't the benefit that perhaps it could have been. Now, the cabin crew was good, and I'm not faulting the service, although it would have been nice if water could have been brought around more than once. The entertainment was fine, and I loved the free wifi, USB port and socket for every seat. The temperature seemed to vary a lot from cold to very warm, and the air was dry (I am comparing it to the 787 here, it's true). But, it was just so very uncomfortable that I cannot see myself using ANZ again. I had considered bidding on an upgrade, but I missed the deadline. When I walked past business class and saw the pods, I was glad I had missed it. They looked really small, cramped, and ""open"". However, as I have never actually flown business class (in 55 years of flying), I can only comment on my perception here. So, in short, I could have paid $250 more for American Airlines and had a much more comfortable trip, along with an extra bag. It's what I'll do next time.",Positive,Positive,Negative,2019

I chose to pay much more for a flight to have it direct from Sydney to Rarotonga as I'm pregnant and I want to spend as little time as possible flying. The first flight from Brisbane to Sydney was delayed and it resulted in me losing the next flight from Sydney to Rarotonga. At Sydney airport the staff were very poor in their communication and were completely unwilling to address our dissatisfaction and dismissed us by saying hat they can't do anything about it. They paid for a cheap hotel overnight and said that the food and transport from the airport was on me and would not fund this. They changed my route for the next day from Sydney to aUCKLAND  and then Rarotonga. This was all beyond my control. I paid a high price for the best direct route and now had to travelled from the worst as they didn't give any other option. I tried to talk to 3 different people from Air New Zealand and the only thing they said is that they can't do anything about it because delays happen. Interesting is that when it is in the other foot there is no way to answer the same way right? If we need to change a flight after one day of the purchase we already have to pay a crazy fee, we can never be late, we can never complain about anything. If Air New Zealand wanted at least to try to be decent with their clients knowing that situation etc the minimum they could do is to offer a upgrade in the flight (as I was utterly exhausted, already lost $1000 in one night's accommodation in the Cook Islands, one whole day of my holiday, car transfer, food, shuttle etc) but not even that. This is disgusting and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. I will never fly air new Zealand again. I could not be more frustrated.

There was absolutely no pleasantries from her at all. We walked out to the plane (past about 8 wheelchairs!) Which for someone newly on crutches was a long way.

I don't care whether you are at the end of your career, being personable, warm and friendly go a long way. Another annoyance is that the chairs do not convert into a full bed, but need to be constructed by the attendants by lying down a separate mattress. You can NOT comfortable lying down when the beds are not made up as your legs are dangling in midair. There was also subtle pressure both to get the beds arranged and disassembled for the sleep time.

Wife bemoaned the fact there was no Pinot Gris, though the stewardess found a couple of glasses from business class. there were two dedicated toilets, one of which was large by airline standards (located on A/B side of plane) dedicated to Premium economy. IFE was excellent with an extensive ranges of films/TV shows, though whilst the seats were great for a short haul flight, they proved not so comfortable for a haul of 12 hours. This was partly due to the cabin being very hot. The footrest was also a bit of a fiddle to move and store back into place. The majority of passengers were dressed comfortable in track-ants and seemed to nod off with little problem. We must learn from this! One thing Air NZ excels at, is the ability to order additional snacks and drinks through seat back TV screen, Free in Business and Premium Economy, though may cost, depending on fare type in economy. There was no WI-FI on this flight, though free WI-FI was available to all passengers on the return flight. Another major plus for Air AZ.

Ordinarily, my understanding was that we had to be at the airport 30 minutes before. I paid for a full 23 kg baggage flight. At Kerikeri the attendant did not greet us. She just said you cant take the bag, you're too late, just take 7 kgs. I told her I was returning to Australia. Her attitude was brash, not helpful and she was not prepared to offer options for me after paying over $500 for the flight. She even smiled when she said sorry the bag can't go. In my mind, the bag could of been taken, thrown into the hold as people were still boarding, the plane had not turned on, the doors were still open. Kerikeri is a 'one horse airport' that if the lights turned out, there is nothing there. It has a plane come in 2 x in a day so extra service can be afforded. It is not like they are rushed off their feet. But this attitude seeps through all of Air New Zealand who provide the same type of basic people in Auckland domestic airport and I had the misfortune of this group in 5 May 2019 when no one helped to show me to my plane access. Didnt take my ticket. Just stood around and said nothing. I even almost missed my flight to Palmerston North because I couldnt understand the announcer who had a hick Pacific Island accent and could not pronounce 'flight boarding' let alone Palmerston North.

She is running down the gang way towards her plane and the other staff stand there taking no notice that she needed help Air New Zealand are shoddy, backward group whose attitude on the ground has to come from an ingrained shoddy management culture and that should be changed.

I got the rudest shake awake while I tried to quickly get myself ready for my meal, the hostess held my meal in front of my face blocking the view of my tray table. She stood they huffing and rolling her eyes. I've not felt so disrespected in a long time. Not only that but my vegetarian meal consisted of cold, stodgy, plain pasta - that I couldn't bring myself to eat. I was then to nervous to ask the staff for snacks after the meal and sat there hungry for the duration. The in flight entertainment was abysmal. The seats won't let you sit comfortably if you are taller than 5ft6''. There was a constant line for the toilets, which meant they weren't cleaned.

The herringbone seats aren't great for communication when travelling with others, but no worse than Qantas Business suites in this regard, although AirNZ are a bit more cramped.

Seat 2K is a window seat on the right side of the cabin. It is row two of the nine rows in Business Class on version 2 of ANZ’s 787-9. Three seats abreast herringbone configuration. The crew walks past this seat, over and over, delivering food and drinks to the seven rows of business class passengers behind it, as do passengers on their way to the business-class galley and restrooms. On my outbound flight to Auckland I sat in the last row of business class. It was a better, quieter, more private experience. Overhead storage for seat 2K, like all other window seats, is consumed by bedding. The first three rows of the center section have zero overhead storage (though the bedding can be stored behind those seats), so the passengers in the center seats must use the storage space that would have otherwise been available to passengers in the window seats. The fellow from the center seat had already filled the half of the bin that was not filled with bedding. Space is limited to begin with, and there is no usable underseat space. I pulled my mattress and pillow out of the overhead storage bin so that the fellow in the center seat and I could both stow our carry-ons. When the FA told me I couldn't put the mattress in the sizable, yawning cavity behind my seat, I told him he should try to find a space for it. So he took it away into the nether regions of the forward galley. As I sit here, my shoes are under the ottoman and there's a pillow and blanket on the floor where my feet are supposed to be. There's no armrest for my right arm. Crew is really nice in dealing with my, er, ""concern"" about the lack of storage space. Probably as exasperated about it as I. They are as pleasant, tactful, and as helpful as they can be. Really delightful people, dealing with what seem to be poor design features. They served champagne before departure, and that was nice. There's a little fold-out shelf behind my right arm and shoulder, but I don't know that it has any practical use. It is also lit, for some reason known only to Boeing and, presumably, ANZ. It's certainly not a place to put an empty champagne glass. The ANZ headphones are not good. I'd advise travelers to bring their own headphones. There's a jack to plug them into so that you can listen to the inflight entertainment, and both a USB charging port and a 110v outlet for your own devices. As I found on my previous long-haul ANZ flight on the same aircraft type, there appears to be a heat source under the seat. After a short time lying in the bed it becomes sweltering hot. I found the bed itself, under the mattress, to be warm. Very uncomfortable when used as a bed. The plane has large windows but they are behind you, so looking out of them requires turning your head more than 90 degrees. The view out the window would be better than the view of the feet and unclad legs of the person across the aisle, who's wearing shorts and went to bed shortly after takeoff, before dinner. Food is delicious and plentiful. Snacks are available any time. Overall, ANZ’s service is excellent, both on the ground and on the plane. The crew was marvelous. The aircraft is new and modern. But the seat layout and design, the lack of storage space both in the overhead and around the seat, and the temperature of the bed leaves much to be desired. As a result, I’m not sure the additional cost of a business-class ticket is worth the money.",Positive,Positive,Neutral,2018

Having to collect bags again, check in again, go through security screening again and wait again for a flight that is delayed again! Anyway horrendous trip home via Auckland and bus to Hamilton. A trip where we were meant to be home by 7.45pm refreshed for work the next day turned into an 11.45pm exhausted mess. I thought this only happened with the likes of Jetstar not Air NZ.

The flight itself on Air New Zealand was fine with a friendly cabin crew, but the problems we had with the airline was getting the flight to operate. Our flight was continuously delayed at CNS until they finally decided to cancel our flight to AKL due to crew rest hours. The cancellation announcement came 2.5 hours after we were supposed to originally take off. The passengers were told to meet at a gate and it was a 15 minute wait to have an employee direct everyone to baggage claim to reclaim their bags and find a service desk to help all the stranded passengers. When the service desk opened another 20 minutes later there was only one employee figuring out arrangements and accommodations for a full flight. We waited in the middle of the line and after another 2.5 hours of waiting in the service line the employee told the passengers still waiting to be helped that they could find their own accommodations and transportation and be reimbursed, or they could go home and meet at the airport at 5 am for the rescheduled flight at 8 am the next morning. The airline was having trouble finding hotels for all the passengers and wasted everyone’s time by not telling everyone that they could find their own accommodations and be reimbursed hours earlier. We have a future flight with Air New Zealand from AKL to SFO and we asked if we could be upgraded on that 14 hour flight to better seats instead of the airline finding us a hotel or reimbursing us, and we were rudely told that the airline doesn’t do upgrades. The next morning we got to the airport as soon as the check in line opened and only one person was checking people in and helping people with their hotel reimbursements. We were also asked if we wanted a voucher for a complimentary breakfast instead of automatically being given the voucher.

This resulted in me having to forfeit my connecting AA flight in IAH (to MIA) due to the much later arrival time. Air NZ stubbornly refused to compensate me for this so I had to suck it up and purchase a brand new flight. I must say that the Premium check-in area at AKL made me feel special. I have to comment though on the seating in Business Premier - who signed off on this design and lay-out (herringbone)? Unable to glance out of the window and feet facing towards the aisle. The seating pods had the dubious honour of feeling both enclosed and claustrophobic, yet without any sense of privacy. The food was also disappointing with virtually the same menu as the MEL - AKL sector, with really small portions. Lastly, making your Business customers pay for WiFi was just plain mean.

Seats etc. were ok although outdated in regards to comfort which was probably because we flew with an older 777-200ER. However we never experienced such a bad crew: - Safety: they did not show much concern for safety or did everything in a rush. When they prepared the cabin for landing they were in such a rush that they did not even check if we had our seatbelts on. One of the crew members was more busy looking outside the door window to look at the islands. Service: very bad, slow and unfriendly. - Entertainment: best part of the flight, although the volume of announcements during the flight (even safety related) were so low you almost could not hear them which maybe was the reason why we missed a welcome announcement of some sort. - Crew did not care for the passengers or to keep the cabin tidy. Not once in a 5 hour flight they cleaned up the rubbish or asked if we would like to have more drinks. We had to hold on to our used coffee cups and cans even during the landing because they did not prepare the cabin for landing. Towards the end of the flight they served a small breakfast when the pilot informed them to prepare cabin for landing which put them out of concept and put everyone in a rush. This was by far the worst flight in a premium cabin we ever had. It was the first time we flew with this airline and after our return flight it will also be the last time. Compared to other Star Alliance members the difference, especially looking at the crew, is like day and night. Not recommended!",Negative,Positive,Negative,2018

The flight from wellington was delayed by several hours, we were not even kept in the clear as to why this was the case, i spent hours and hours at the airport receiving delay after delay texts. The fact that I cant even buy a ticket for a friend or partner is also very poorly thought through. I bought a ticket for my partner as a surprise and had it emailed to me but now due to Air New Zealand taking it upon themselves to monitor Facebook sites like NZ flight swap, they flag down people on flights where there has been a swap or sale monitored, and flag down people, refusing to let them on the plane. At least let people who have paid for your service and bought this seat, give the ticket to someone, if they can't themselves make it or if it was a present. Monitoring these seats and not letting people on is in my opinion ridiculous. Why wouldn't you allow a service like a name change? Allowing us to pay a fee of perhaps $20 to change the name on the ticket so that you can still use the flight?

It is worth the USD 600 paid to have an empty middle seat, but the three seats are near useless as a lie-down bed for a normal size adult. For two adults side-by-side, it’s almost impossible. On two flights nobody on our plane tried to use SkyCouch as a bed. I suffer from chronic leg cramps and excruciating muscle spasms in my legs [if not stretched every hour or so]. Not to mention the possibility of pulmonary vein thrombosis in a 73-yr-old person such as myself. I did have one episode of a terrible muscle spasm, which necessitated me having to unbuckle my seat belt and stand up to put weight on my leg to relieve the spasm. Luckily, the flight was smooth at the time and no flight attendant had to order me to sit down [without regard to the severe pain that would cause me]. However, as I was stretching my leg and walking to a restroom, an attendant told me I needed to return to my seat when the captain activated the fasten seat belt sign. I’m a veteran traveler and know it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion with a flight attendant following airline rules and guidelines and will not or cannot make exceptions no matter how much pain and discomfort a passenger might endure. Nonetheless, I did take a moment to explain my difficult situation to the young stewardess, who probably could not imagine my 73-yr-old condition. Of course, she showed no sensitivity or understanding whatsoever, and told me - in a tone which indicated she thought I may have been senile - that I might bump my head in rough air if I were not seated and secured with a fastened seat belt. The fact that may have caused me excruciating pain did not register at all with her. She could have cared less. In such a situation the risk to my safety and good health was far worse if I were seated and buckled-in than if I were allowed to stand for a few minutes until the spasm passed and the pain lessened. I doubt that this review will result in a more tolerant and enlightened approach by ANZ [or any other alrilnes’ flight attendants], but I hope this description of my situation on NZ28 [departure from AKL on Feb 23] might result in attendants having a more open-minded approach to dealing with a passenger’s medical issue. But I sincerely doubt it. On a non-medical issue, how about ANZ joining the 21st century and providing satelite WiFi with Internet on the IAH-AKL route?",Negative,Negative,Neutral,2018

Air New Zealand has a serious problem with the online booking in that it limits the number of characters of the name to 28. They say it is a legal requirement of international aviation, which I know is not the case as I book online and travel internationally with many different airlines, and no other airline limits the length of the name! This problem has caused hours of head-ache for myself and everyone in my extended family and I’m sure other people with long names. I have sent emails to the 'top’ of Air NZ and no-one is listening. They keep repeating the same old story about 'it's a legal requirement to limit the name to 28 characters’. Sadly I made the mistake of booking a flight again this May with Air New Zealand flying co-share on Singapore Airlines, but I'm told by Singapore Airlines they cannot issue a ticket and cannot guarantee that I can board the flight, because my name is not correct! I've called Air New Zealand 3 times with very long phone queues at $1 a minute from Cuba where I live and they say they can't do anything about it. The computer won't allow them to add all the letters in my passport! So now I am left with a ticket on Singapore Airlines that I don’t know I can use on the day of the flight, because Air New Zealand prejudices against people with long names under the premise that it is aviation law. And do they care about this annoying complaint from a small section of their customers, probably not.

I chose the basic option without even a checked bag. You still get a decent amount of free water, tea and coffee on the flight and can make use of the non-movie part of the IFE, in particular their great music selection. One further downside of the two most basic fare options is that Air NZ requires you to pay for choosing your seat even at check-in, which gives the experience a low-cost feel. If you do not pay, the system chooses a seat for you. The seat pitch on the B777 was decent, the pitch on the A320 very tight for a 3 1/2 hours flight. At least, I was lucky that I had an aisle seat on the latter flight. One element that was consistently excellent throughout the two flights was the service of the cabin crew.",Positive,Positive,Neutral,2017

Paid extra for the Premium Economy seats. When boarded appalled that had to turn sideways down the aisle. From a safety standpoint I don't know how this is allowed, because in an emergency there is no room for rendering medical aid or even to evacuate properly. The aisle narrowness also proved a problem later when I tried to sleep (I am a thin lady and don't spill over seat sides) and I was constantly banged into by crew and passengers going down the aisle. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable, the premium seats have a leg rest below the seat that lifts up and provides no comfort other than take away more space and leg room. These seats would only work if there are two family members of small stature seated in the three seat row by themselves otherwise they are useless. As it was my knees were up against the front seat and if the passenger in front reclines their seat you can't eat off your tray and well you feel crushed. On the flight back my seat recline button was broken and I couldn't sleep. The passenger in front of my mother reclined their seat after they had served coffee and it went all over her clothes and ruined them. I have been on budget flights such as Ryan Air and been more comfortable. This is unacceptable for a long haul flight costing as much or more than other airlines in this category. I flew Air New Zealand 7 years ago and it was the best airline I had ever flown and recommended them to everyone. It was the only reason I chose them again and I wish I read the reviews on this site before booking them over Virgin Atlantic or British Airways. I will never fly Air New Zealand again or recommend them to anyone. Look at the photos I have attached and you can see for yourself. I feel sorry for the crew having to work in such cramped quarters and especially for the passengers who were continuing on to Auckland. Oh and there is a feature on the inflight entertainment that allows you to order snacks drinks from your seat. This feature was only ever activated for a period of 30 minutes on each flight.

I do not expect the service and amenities to be the same now as then but am disappointed on how bare-bones they are now. For instance: on a 14+ hour flight from Auckland to Houston there is no snack, beverage or even water served until the meal about two hours into the flight. I know snacks are not about nourishment but to alleviate boredom and make it seem as though something is happening. I can't verify it but I'm sure the meal trays are shrinking. Dinner, while usually good, was appalling. Some sort of mystery chicken chunks with a spicy sauce and rice. Breakfast (I chose the fruit option) was only one muffin, one container of yoghurt and a measly fruit plate including—in the height of the USA's growing season—two slices of canned peaches! That was it as far as food went. I did go to the galley to get a cookie in the night. During the long night a flight attendant came by with water only once. I have restless legs and don't sleep for more than an hour or two at a time and even then very lightly so it wasn't that I missed the water coming around. That was okay with me though as I brought my own 2 liters of water as I won't drink water stored in tanks on aircraft's. I've flown round trip on a Air New Zealand long haul flights on average twice every three years for thirty years. My previous flight to the US was on American Airlines in May 2017, also in economy. I wasn't expecting much but was happily surprised. They still gave out hot towels after takeoff and one other time (I forgot when, maybe before breakfast) they also gave out snacks and a beverage after takeoff and all water was from sealed water bottles. They had lots of different snacks in the galley during the night, not just small Cookie Time cookies and some sort of chips. I still like Air New Zealand for domestic flights and will fly with them if the price is right. I tried to ""one up"" to premium economy but my bid wasn't high enough. I feel it is a safe airline and that's the most important thing but 14+ hours is a long time. The in seat entertainment is great, I watched four movies as well as reading an e-book.

As a New Zealand Citizen I can say I have zero bias in this topic. My last flight with Air NZ was cancelled with no prior email notice and resulted in me having to wait a number of hours for the next flight. It was a small 2:2 domestic flight (around 1 hour air time) leaving on a clear night however cancelled without notice. When I asked the ticket staff they were unable to give me a reason as to why the flight was cancelled. This is purely theory however It is likely that they cancelled the earlier flight due to the fact that the passengers of my original flight and of the one I ended up taking could have fit in one plane. Although this is a smart business decision (cutting costs for the same gain) it is a betrayal of customer trust and time. Not only was I not given a reson for the cancel but was too given no notification of it until reaching the airport.

Having flown to the US a few times with Air New Zealand, it is unfortunate to see that their standards have slipped and service is inconsistent. Overall the experience in Business Premier was acceptable considering the special price I booked. I used to recommend the airline but I would be less enthusiastic to recommend Air NZ if paying full price for Business or if flying in economy. The check-in at Sydney Airport was absolutely appalling, the whole experience took 40 minutes and after waiting 15 minutes in the priority line I was rudely told to go back to the automatic check-in machines, despite other passengers in the business check-in being served at the counter. The check-in machines didn't work properly (which is why I went straight to the counter), so a staff member had to be located to do it for me, then I had to drag the bags back to the check-in counter to stand in line again for another 15 minutes at least. I understand this is the process when flying in economy, but this fell so short of the mark for business it wasn't funny, and the different treatment for other (older) customers was insulting. When I did eventually manage to get to the lounge in Sydney, the barista service was nice, I was able to find a seat and the choice of food was good. However I preferred the vastly superior views at the old lounge (before they renovated about 3 years ago I think). The Business Premier seats on the 777s are comfortable and I find the bed excellent. The meal service overall was fine. I prefer to dine in the lounge instead and only eat lightly on the flight. I recommend taking the Peter Gordon dining options where offered, or having the cold appetizer or soup (which they always seem to have) as those are the most reliable. The breakfast smoothies are also consistently excellent. I had waffles for breakfast and that was also good. On the return flight from San Francisco to Auckland, I found the menu options a bit unappetizing. Usually I have the fast dine option, but it was a creamy cauliflower soup which is not what I wanted, so I ended up with three courses of a cold Gazpacho soup (good), chicken main (average) and lemon shortcake dessert (average). The hot breakfast options were eggs or pancakes which I didn't bother with, I just had the continental breakfast of a smoothie then fruit and yoghurt, all of which was fine. Having taken this route with Air NZ a few times both on the old 747s and the 777s, unfortunately it is noticeable how much noisier the 777s are. Even with noise cancelling headphones, the noise was annoying on the return flight and it reduced my sleep time. The 300s are marginally quieter than the 200s but compared to being at the front of a 747 or an A380s it is loud. If you are flying to LA the 787s would be great, but the San Francisco flights are on 777s. Air NZ use the Singapore Airlines lounge at SFO. I understand it's the best of an average bunch and the only one with airside showers apart from United First. Food options in the lounge were quite good. If you want to use the showers, make sure you get in quick as they had a total of four towels and couldn't be bothered to get any in until the next Singapore flight after the Air NZ one had left, very poor service. I had to buy a towel at the airport as a result. You also have to ask them to unlock the showers, what a pain.

Information provided on baggage policies etc is inconsistent or not disclosed by all agents so be very careful to ask and keep a record. Not all agents disclose full fee policies. For example, one time the airline tried to withhold a service fee from a refund.

On a recent trip from Los Angeles to Adelaide return via Auckland, our outbound aircraft from LAX was late arriving from London. They chose to hold our plane for customers out of London to clear customs as opposed to offloading them from our aircraft and putting them on the other flight to Auckland which is scheduled after the one I was on. They boarded us and then made us wait on the aircraft for 1.5 hours waiting for passengers. We arrived in Auckland just as my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. Even though they held us for 1.5 hours in LAX, they did not hold our flight to Adelaide for 45 minutes. They rerouted us through Sydney. We boarded the flight to Sydney and then proceeded to sit on that aircraft for more than an hour waiting for the passengers from the trailing flight from LA. Also, they did not give me a boarding pass in Auckland while other passengers were given their boarding passes. Because of holding the flight to Sydney, we then missed our connecting flight in Sydney and essentially we just dumped to Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand washed their hands of us. On my original Auckland to Adelaide flight I had a Works Deluxe ticket which is similar to a business class ticket but on the Virgin Australia flight they did not acknowledge a much higher priced ticket. I wrote to Air New Zealand and it took them more than two weeks to respond and provided an unsatisfactory response. Also, because of the issues I tried to access my reservation online and could not. I called and they redid the booking. However, when I got to the airport for my return, they had removed my Works Deluxe from Adelaide to Auckland even though it was on my original ticket. Further, on the return from Auckland to LA I had bid for a one up and they gave it to me at a cost even though there were empty seats remaining and this could have been a way for them to demonstrate they had not done a job they should have done on the outbound. In total the poor judgement by Air New Zealand added seven hours to my travel to Adelaide and I was on the phone with them for over an hour working on getting me online access to my return travel and they did not provide the miles due to me from Auckland onward.

Once we were onboard it was evident why this advice was offered. The aisles are extremely narrow with the 3x4x3 configuration and my husband needed to make sure his elbow was always tucked in for fear of being hit by the meal/drinks carts or the crew walking up and down.

The kiwi cabin crew on the AUK-LAX legs would rate slightly above their UK counterparts but nothing was too much trouble and the level of service excellent on all legs. Air NZ does not offer WiFi yet but Bluetooth is able to be used, which I took advantage of as the headphones provided aren’t up to noise cancelling quality of Bose or Plantronics (my choice). Take an adapter if you want to use your own phones with the inflight entertainment system. There was a fair choice of films including some with subtitles but personally I preferred my own entertainment on iPad and tablet. The transit through LAX is not easy with long distances to walk and queues for immigration and security as the Air NZ lounge is landside. The transit time is supposed to be 2 hours but don’t expect much time in the lounge especially if the incoming flight is late. My wife had wheelchair assistance and so did I on the return due to a reoccurring problem. Auckland and Heathrow were very good but some of the “assistors” in LAX looked as if they needed wheelchairs themselves. The only blemish as far as Air NZ are concerned was that they “lost” my wife’s TravelScoot, which failed to appear at Auckland on the return leg. It turned up a couple of days later after being off loaded in LAX by mistake, probably due to incorrect labelling when it was checked in at Heathrow.

I am a Kiwi expat, have lived in London for 17 years and have used Air New Zealand many times over the years when returning to NZ to see family. I have to say that gradually, over time, I believe the airline has fallen into the trap of believing its own PR. The first thing you hear when you get on a flight these days is about the latest award the airline has won. While there have been upgrades over the years to the fleet, in-flight entertainment and recently check-in procedures (more on this later), the personal touch and focus on service that made the airline stand out, are no longer as obvious and seem to be replaced with a slightly superior cockiness that is not that attractive. Over recent flights Air New Zealand have dropped a brand new solid suitcase on its corner, stoving it in. When I complained (which was extremely time consuming and difficult), I was told the suitcase still works fine so Air New Zealand were not going to offer anything by way of remediation. Lost our luggage between Auckland and Wellington (via the high tech new check-in procedure). When I registered concern on the return flight I was told by a cocky attendant that Air New Zealand doesn't lose luggage so I must have been on another airline!). Ironically when we registered our lost luggage we were in a not insignificant queue and the ground staff gave the impression that this was a very frequent event. On my last trip, 4 out of 6 flights on the return journey from London to Wellington were late, one of which arrived very late in Auckland which required a group of transferring passengers to run from domestic to international to make the next flight. This caused stress and anxiety. While I am sure Air New Zealand would say that some of the causal factors are out of its control, I think it is the general air of disinterest mixed with self congratulatory arrogance that puts me off the most. Will I continue to use Air New Zealand - well possibly because the network of flights to and from the UK is generally very convenient in terms of door to door elapsed travel time.

I noticed large tour group from China required a Chinese-speaking staff to press the kiosk screens to check in for them. Then you drop the bag onto the continuously running conveyor belt yourself, with poorly designed ergonomics. Also it doesn't matter if you are elite or Koru Club members - you still drop the bags yourself. There are still agents at the gate (for the time being). Boarding is done through rows in order. Often if you are sitting at rows 16 or over you are required to exit the airbridge halfway, climb down stairs walk over the tarmac and reboard via stairs at the rear door. The seats are standard, with pitch left to the bare minimum. They are often rather dirty as well. Safety demonstration is by videos. It is often slick marketing that does not really impart information easily enough to passengers especially non-English speaking ones. Inflight you are offered a cookie or crisp with only tea, coffee, or mineral water. No meals or hot snacks are available. If you fly during Koru Hours (before 8 am and 4:30 pm to 7 pm) you get cheese and crackers instead of cookies and crisps and beer and wine are available as additional options. Breakfast fare is muffins. Staff are friendly - which is the only redeeming feature. Almost all flights between Christchurch and Wellington use the ATR-72 these days which means you walk in the rain on the tarmac on wet days, plus greater chance of weather-related delays, and reduced comfort level due to narrower seats and much smaller overhead lockers. The rationale is to offer ""hourly service given the current level of demand"". This is a defacto hybrid carrier - not really a full service unlike Cathay Pacific or even Qantas. Decision-makers listen to what some business travellers (not all) want, yet they ended up making a the majority unhappy. Overall, I will pick Air New Zealand for domestic flights just because they are the only airline offering reasonable schedules. The only competitor (Jetstar) offers only a few flights per day and on main trunk routes only plus a few turboprop flights. However I will actively go out of my way to avoid Air New Zealand when flying internationally.",Negative,Negative,Neutral,2016

First flew this airline for business in 2015 in Premium class and had a good experience. This year, four of us flew economy with my son and I in emergency row seats and my wife and daughter in a skycouch. Never again will we travel with Air New Zealand. The aircraft was delayed in Sydney so we missed the Auckland connection to SFO and were stuck 12 hours at Sydney which is one of the worst airports in the world. I have no argument with delaying an aircraft for safety reasons. However, as the hours ticked by and it became obvious that the reason the flight was delayed on the grounds that the aircraft was being cleaned proved false and there were technical problems, the counter staff became ruder and ruder in answering our questions. The lack of information was appalling. All we got were text messages every couple of hours. We finally arrived in Auckland the day after and got seats on the SFO bound flight for the 11th June and not the 10th as in the original flight. Neither my son or I got emergency row seats and the skycouch proved to be a joke. The seats are hard and abrasive and my wife and daughter didn't sleep a wink. A waste of an extra $700 for no discernible benefit. The airline is now quibbling about refunding the extra funds paid for the lack of an emergency row seat on the forward leg as I was given a 'preferred' seat on the flight from Auckland to SFO. This preferred seat was right up the back on the window. I am 188 cms tall and could not move without waking the persons in the middle and aisle seats and was extremely uncomfortable and did not sleep the entire flight.

In my opinion, Air New Zealand's standards have really slipped since I flew with them in 2010. We flew Apia to Auckland, then Auckland to Sydney the next day. When I made our bookings 2 months before travelling, I only had a small selection of the worst seats on the aircraft (which I had to pay $40 each leg to choose) as the better seats were reserved for Air New Zealand's richer passengers to choose from. Air New Zealand have brought in a policy of penny pinching now and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of you. You now have to pay for luggage, for a meal and even censored in flight entertainment of any quality - with the crew only offering water to us occasionally, while people around me were served meals and drinks etc that they had pre-purchased. To me, this would be fine on a short flight (1-2 hours) on a budget carrier, but not on flights exceeding 4 hours. I opted to pay $10 for all movies in the end, but was pretty disappointed to find that the film I watched had been heavily censored and there were constant interruptions every time an announcement was made (usually about food, or welcoming platinum members etc) and including annoying messages popping up on the screen during films and games. The check in at Auckland the next day was a disaster. Unless you were a business / premium passenger, you are forced to spend ages trying to use their automated check in machines that are very complicated and frustrating, then have to use another even more complicated machine to drop bags off. In both cases, we needed help from 3 members of staff.  The ground staff were helpful and the cabin crews, although not particularly warm, did their job. Air New Zealand have a fleet of modern aircraft and the 2 Boeing 777 aircraft that we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. At this stage, I will avoid Air New Zealand if travelling to or through New Zealand again. I'd rather go for a full service airline, not a budget airline.",Negative,Negative,Negative,2016

Cheeses to follow were inedible and while the wine was nice, it certainly was not free flowing. Felt a little bit of a cheap experience overall. The overall cost of the meal, including what passed as a starter, cannot have been more than $10.

The trip got off to a couple of bad starts, I couldn't check in from Queenstown to Geneva since the tickets were not connnected, so I had to drag my luggage between the terminals in Auckland. Then when I tried to check in for Geneva from Auckland they would only check me in to Shanghai since apparently Air NZ can not check people in to transit Shanghai to Air China. This needs to be fixed since I spent 2 hours in queues to get out and back into the airport in Shanghai, I would never fly this route again because of this problem. The terminal walkway in Auckland really needs to be covered since it is frequently raining, it is a bit of a national disgrace that uncovered walkway, not a good way to great arriving tourists. Flying the Dreamliner made this longhaul flight more pleasant, the higher humidity and cabin pressure left me feeling less drained than usual. The entertainment system is excellent with gate to gate service and a good selection of movies. Most importantly the system does not have boxes under the seats making a lot more legroom available. I was lucky to get a sky couch row to myself since the plane was only half full and was able to have the full sky couch to myself for sleeping.

Felt crammed with seats and very narrow aisles. Sitting by the aisle meant being bumped and pushed by people going past including one of the cabin crew – a big man who banged into me every time he passed and kicked my foot once with never an apology. Seat pitch was OK because the seats are very thin with little padding. Seat belts aren’t very long and if you’re a larger person the buckle is under the armrest which is uncomfortable and awkward to access. IFE was good but no inflight magazine and no entertainment listing. All you get is a food price list and a safety card which was better than the All Blacks safety video. Explored the onscreen offerings which weren’t well laid out. I stumbled on a good TV program that popped up on the screen but couldn’t find tell my partner how to access it. There’s no menu card or indication of what meals and drink service is offered. As one of the cabin crew grumpily instructed the passenger next to us, you have to use the online screen to order a drink. Having figured it out I ordered two drinks and some vege chips (the only food item besides a pre-packed cookie available without paying for it). After a while one of the drinks arrived but not the other one. We asked if it was coming and were told it should be. However it didn’t. Eventually my partner decided to order it again but they’d closed the kitchen. So I rang and asked for the drink. Steward wasn’t happy but finally came back took the order and went and fetched the drink. The food was mediocre served with plastic cutlery on tiny trays. The sparkling and the white wine was shocking quality. The cabin crew service was perfunctory and bored.

I the asked a steward if I am able to order a snack, his reply was we are too busy for Taking food order. I then waited 30 mins and tried again still kitchen closed, so I asked another steward and his response was it closed as their no hot food left.

We thought that by the time we drive to the accommodation and settle the kids down to sleep then it wouldn’t be long before we had to wake up and get organized and drive back to the airport. We decided to stay at the airport as it was now midnight and our young kids (and us) just wanted to sleep. When we arrived at the ‘area’ which Air NZ said they would make available for us we just couldn’t believe it. We had be taken to one of the airports main entrances with hardfloor tiles and we were crammed in with 200 other people. It was like a bad dream. It was a very long/cold horrible night. Finally the time came to check-in again and we went through customs. We had Duty Free bottles with us from the previous days check-in. At the customs 'bag screening' we were kindly told that Air NZ should not have neglected in telling us that our Duty Free bottles should have been packed in our checked-in luggage before re-entering customs again. They confiscated our Duty Free, took a copy of one of our boarding passes and encouraged us to go and see the Duty Manager of Air NZ and they would sort it for us. We did this and the Air NZ staff were very understanding of our situation and said they would arrange to go and pick up the Duty Free from customs and get it on our flight. When we were boarding the plane to Raro the Duty Manager approached us and totally confirmed that our Duty Free was sorted and we can pick it up at the Fragile Luggage area at Raro Airport. When we arrived at Rarotonga unfortunately our Duty Free hadn’t made it on the plane at all. The lovely staff at Rarotonga made notes and said she would contact Air NZ in Sydney for us. The next day we got a phonecall and apparently our Duty Free was still sitting in Sydney airport waiting for someone from Air NZ to go and pick it up and put it on a plane to Rarotonga. After many enquiries from us it never turned up at Rarotonga which was disappointing.  Air NZ staff were always very polite however it was the lack of 'follow-through' and unfullfillled expectations on Air NZ’s part which we feel extremely let down by.",Positive,Positive,Negative,2015

The only drawback is the footrest which is awkward. Main advantage in P/E is the legroom and space. Our view is that all seats should be like this. Economy cattle class now really is horrible.

Air NZ's safety video remains hmm quirky though some passengers now find it a little OTT and are fed up with the continued hyping of the Lord of the Rings movies.

Took the Premium Economy class flight to and from Auckland and I loved it. The seats are spacious and comfortable and it definitely felt much better than a red-eye flight on Economy. The complimentary bottle of water is a great touch because you do tend to get very dehydrated on a flight and having the bottle meant you didn't have to ask for a glass of water from the attendants every 10 minutes or so. The pillow provided is big and soft and very comfortable whether to hug or to prop against your back. The USB and power outlet though not uncommon anymore are still very much appreciated. I'm not sure if this feature exists in other airlines or if it's even a plausible concept but it may be great if a passenger can play his/her own media via a USB device eg. movies on a thumb drive or the sort. On the flight to Auckland there were just a handful of people in the Premium Economy cabin so service was impeccable and thoughtful right from the start. The attendants even came around mid-flight to make sure everything was okay for me. On my return it was a fully- booked flight so the attendants really had their work cut out for them. But they were still thoughtful and reasonably efficient. I would definitely fly with Air NZ again if I get the chance. Oh and did I mention that their safety video is really ""epic""?

Having lived in London for the last 11 years I was on a flight moving back to New Zealand permanently. Flew with Singapore Airlines on SQ317 from London to Singapore and had excellent service the whole way. The flight attendants were friendly food was served quickly and was delicious trays were removed quickly and we were constantly provided refreshments. At the beginning of the flight my sister was having problems with her entertainment console so the attendant offered to re-boot the system. it was done immediately and they checked after a couple of minutes that it was working. It happened a couple of times during the flights so the attendant gave her a voucher to use towards a duty free item which was a very kind gesture. However our onwards flight from Singapore to Auckland was extremely disappointing and one of the worst long haul flights I have been on. Most of the flight attendants were very friendly (I did hear one tell a traveller that they couldn't fix their console as they were about to serve food which seemed very unhelpful) however their service was extremely lacking. Shortly after taking off we discovered that our entertainment consoles were not working properly but either continually freezing or losing sound. We pressed the buzzer for a flight attendant but after waiting 10 mins and watching them walk past us a couple of times we had to ask them in person for assistance. Rather than offer to re-boot the consoles as Singapore Airlines had done we were informed that they had been aware of the problem in Singapore but were unable to fix it until they got to Auckland. For a passenger on a 9 hour flight who has already travelled on a 12 hour flight just beforehand this was very disappointing news. We were both transferred to other seats (seated separately) however the cabin was so cold further forward that I ended up returning to my original seat. The service and quality of the food was also very disappointing. The chicken dinner we were served was very salty and the breakfast omelette was rubbery. The chicken sausage accompanying it was inedible. The attendants were also extremely slow with clearing the trays in comparison to Singapore Airlines. My sister is has Gold airpoints status so we had priority labels on our luggage however we were one of the last to get our luggage upon arrival in Auckland. Overall it was an extremely disappointing and frustrating flight.

We had booked and paid for this flight on 14th August 2014. Normal check-in procedures did not work and we were advised that the flight had a weight problem and we should check back at 2.30. We advised that we would miss a medical appointment made 4 months previously if we did not catch the flight. When we checked back we were advised that we could not go as the plane had a weight issue. Our luggage was not weighed at any time prior to this and was about half of the allowed weight. If the issue really was one of weight then Air New Zealand is obviously incapable of flying with the baggage allowances that it has set and if passengers with half that allowance are denied access to a flight booked over 6 months previously then they should look at a fairer way of deciding exactly who they will allow on planes. It would seem that this was just an excuse and I strongly suspect that the real issue was that Air New Zealand had over-booked the flight and the issue was one of seating on the plane. If this is indeed the case then it would have been better to have been told this from the outset instead of being jerked around by being told to return at 2.30 pm. Air New Zealand did arrange for alternative travel the next day and they did arrange for overnight accommodation with meals (but no drinks at all including non-alcoholic drinks and the meal allowance for dinner was only sufficient for the main course without either entree or dessert). They also provided both of us with $300 travel vouchers with them but we feel that being lied to and treated in a shoddy manner once by a company is unfortunate: to give that company the opportunity of doing it again is stupidity.,Positive,Negative,Negative,2015

Firstly the seat - it's in a shell so the seat tilts and slides rather than reclines into the space behind you. You're also angled slightly and so if you're in the outer seats you're not obliged to talk to the person next to you - it's your own personal space. I paid the extra for seats at the front of the cabin and they're well worth the upgrade - so much legroom and easy to get in and out (useful if travelling solo). The centre seats are better for couples as you can share the space. Check their website for information. The food was excellent served on crockery with metal cutlery. You'll get your starter etc first and wait some time for the hot meal meanwhile your dessert is also sat in front of you being very tempting! The hot food was good although the menu options were a little unusual - both times I went for the fish as the other options (beef and chicken) contained various things I didn't care for. The service was impeccable - the staff were very friendly except one attendant who seemed a little off although still professional. Inflight entertainment is on a decent sized touch screen although there is also a remote in the side of the seat. The selection was surprising - there were a large number of retro movies rather than all the latest blockbusters (of which there were few). However this was actually quite nice as I watched a few older favourites rather than having to gamble on new choices. My favourite thing about the IFE was being able to order drinks and snacks from the screen. Just tap an option or two and it's delivered to your seat a few minutes later whilst you continue to watch your movie. All seats have USB sockets for charging and I think you can link them up to a USB drive but I didn't test this. Also charging sockets are available for your laptop. You can use a standard UK plug as well as US and some other options. The toilets! Firstly two toilets dedicated to Premium Economy - so no queuing. And they were the best - fancy wallpaper with funny fake bookshelves on it (read some of the titles) and music piped in too. Frankly I would pay the upgrade just for those! Finally when flying to the USA you are right near the front of the plane so you're off quickly and can hot foot it to immigration to hopefully beat the queues. Unless you have ridiculously high standards of what you expect from a metal tube flying through the air I don't think you'll be disappointed.,Positive,Positive,Positive,2015

You also get lounge access and the onboard economy meal. I actually had to argue with the booking agent that I was entitled to money back. I had to explain that I had purchased a business class ticket (for myself wife and son) and now that they no longer provided me with business class they actually owed me money. Eventually they relented. The aircraft was absolutely disgusting. It was ancient (or looked ancient). My family was in 1A 1C and 1D (no one was in 1F or in row two at all). There was no divider wall in front of row one so I had to privilege of basically sitting in the galley for three hours watching the flight attendants work. My son was seated in 1C but I had to move him because ""he was too young for an exit row"". Since when is row one an exit row? We were sitting opposite two flight attendants. Wouldn't they operate the door in an emergency? Where they expecting my 9 year old to do it? Air New Zealand's seat selection system is the worst. It is time for the IT department to let you pick specific seats for each passenger instead of picking a block of seats for you. The seats on this aircraft had perhaps a millimetre of recline. It was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have never been on. The entertainment system worked poorly and my son's did not work at all. The only positive is that the Air New Zealand staff are perhaps the nicest people anywhere. I have never had anything but truly outstanding service from the cabin crew on all of my flights with them over the years and this flight was no exception.",Negative,Negative,Negative,2015

Even with the seat in front of me fully raised I could not sit with my legs straight in front rather splayed either side.

Helpful efficient mature staff with excellent food and comfortable seat/bed. Amenity pack is cheap and nasty compared with days past and no pyjamas compared with other airlines at the same or cheaper price point. Lounge in Auckland is good but always crowded lounge in Sydney is worn and needs a furniture update but still perfectly fine to kill the hours before your flight. Lounge staff in LAX are not up to the usual Air NZ standard but the drink selection is good the air- conditioning is cold and the food selection though limited is enough to satisfy for a snack. The showers were not up to the standard of lounges such as Virgin Atlantic and even Swiss International but ok to freshen up before the flight. The 777-300 packs a lot of people into Business class and the staff do seem to take longer than previously. The 767 seats in business are absolutely abysmal and even with the best will in the world I find it impossible to say anything good about them.

On the return I had to fly Virgin to Sydney but an Air New Zealand code share between Sydney and AKL that was the down part of the journey. Narrow seats tatty aircraft pay for a meal pay for everything - the complete opposite of the similar virgin segment on the outward journey. I figured it was because it was a transtasman that Air New Zealand treat passengers like cattle and nickel and dime them but this last trip I decided to go Auckland-LAX direct. Air New Zealand charge $300 more than their rivals you get 1 bag unlike Virgin where you get 2 the plane is dirty the cabin crew are ok a couple were a little off hand to the person in the seat beside me no blanket no eye cover no little pack of toothpaste.

The only reason I rate the satisfaction of my trip 9/10 is that they code share with United who must come bottom of my list (the trip with United between New York and Los Angeles the worst I have ever had). If you fly Air New Zealand to the United States organize your onward trip yourself so that you can avoid flying United.,Positive,Positive,Positive,2014

As regular Perth trippers (like 25 over 20 years) it was one of the most uncomfortable disappointing trips we have experienced. One needs to be almost a contortionist to extricate oneself for toilet visits due to 2 things. One is the closeness of the seat in front when it is reclined coupled with the fact that the intermediate arm rest will not lift high enough to get around comfortably but having achieved that one still has to negotiate around the aisle arm rest which would not lift at all! My wife and I are not high body-mass people! Food quality was definitely not up to previous standards. Trying to play a favourite CD became a rather user/unfriendly mission and when I did get it it was punctuated and disjointed. On disembarking we eyed the PE seats with new interest and are contemplating an upgrade on our return but it shouldn't have to be like that.

On the last occasion this was on a code sharing flight with Virgin. The experience reversed my previous appreciation of the introduction to NZ. The best of NZ Airlines seems to have been undermined by the worst of Virgin. I watched an Air NZ ground staff member stand by and instruct my wife to load her weighty suitcase on to the luggage belt before I could intervene. My wife had spent the previous two days undergoing heart check ups. Furthermore I was impressed to note the speed with which the ground staff requested an extra 80 dollars for an extra bag when it was reasonably evident that the extra bag could have been packed into the non-extra one.

Seat+Bag ticket. SYD-AKL on larger plane (777). Boarding was an issue - boarding gate too small for size of plane/number of passengers and then many passengers started queuing up before boarding called which meant that boarding by row numbers was a bit pointless. Onboard all good as usual although was very cold and I had to get a blanket also I'm a bit sick of the Hobbit safety video. Service great - lots of staff on hand to help with self check-in and bag drop. Onboard didn't have much to do with staff but seemed fine as usual. Used ANZ smartphone app for first time - very nice app and easy to use with helpful info. WEL-SYD on A320. Online check-in easy. Much easier boarding with smaller plane. Otherwise flight similar. Overall - not used to the larger plane with longer boarding and alighting time and I don't really like it so will try to avoid in future bookings. Seats also seemed closer together? Entertainment OK but could have done with a few more TV shows to choose from. Don't really like their new system of paying extra for the preferential seats but understand that there is an opportunity for them to make a bit of extra profit there.

The flight into Raro was fine except for the simply fair quality of food. The seating in economy was comfortable for a 9 hour overnight international flight.

The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure.

Check in at NRT was a breeze and the ANA lounge (as I have Air NZ Elite/Star Alliance Gold status) is pleasant quiet and comfortable with an adequate range of snacks and drinks. Boarding was a bit chaotic as the gate area has people scattered standing around making it difficult to get to priority boarding easily.

The flight was fine. A 4 hour delay before we left Auckland I felt this could have been dealt with a lot more efficiently at Shanghai airport where I had a connecting flight that had just left. First I was told I was to go via Amsterdam to my destination in Zurich then have the flight changed back to my original connecting flight with no directions to the transit desk. Great I thought when the flight was changed back to the original however the very poor English speaker at the transit desk proceeded to give me the wrong time as a consequence I missed my connecting flight. I was finally put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and arrived in Zurich 40 hours after I left home. Added to this my husband and daughter who have travelled separately have had the same delay from Auckland airport.

But what really annoyed me was the treatment I received at check in. We flew from Blenheim to Auckland. A family group of 4 of us checked in. Maybe one case out of the 4 was overweight but they took into account that in total others were lighter and we did not exceed the overall allowance for 4 persons. All good so far. They insisted on weighing my hand luggage which had been stripped down to a few light items but the main content was my CPAP medical machine that deals with my sleep apnea condition a camera tablet and lap top. Overall weight was about 9kgs about 2kgs over the limit of 7kgs. The check in man told me that I was over the limit and would have to remove some items. I pointed out that I had a laptop hoping he would then just let it be. On the flight to Christchurch the Air New Zealand check in told me 9kgs including a laptop was OK and let the bag go. This time the man told me to remove the laptop so he could weigh the bag again. It is an ultra book so extremely light which still made my bag 8kgs. He still wasn't happy and insisted that I remove more items. This was extremely embarrassing for the sake of 1kg but in the end we placed some items in a plastic shopping bag which my wife was allowed to carry on because she only had a handbag. This reduced the weight down to 7kgs which made the check in man happy and I could then put my very light laptop back inside. Rules are rules fair enough but for goodness sake. My wife had next to no hand luggage why couldn't they just aggregate the weight for our group or at least for the 2 of us? In the end I put the items back in my bag anyway but the irony was that it was a small plane and the overhead lockers were too small to even take the regulation hand luggage bag I was using so it had to stay on the floor under the seat in front. So it wasn't as if the bag would have been too heavy for the overhead bin anyway. I expect this kind of treatment from a LCC but not from a full fare carrier like Air New Zealand. It was very embarrassed and it just left a bitter taste for the whole flight. I won't be rushing back to Air NZ I can assure you.,Positive,Positive,Negative,2013

I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.,Positive,Positive,Positive,2013

I had originally booked a return flight from London Heathrow to Auckland via Hong Kong but Air NZ axed their LHR-HKG route before I returned. They were not able to book me onto a flight to Hong Kong and so booked me to Shanghai instead and then onwards from Shanghai to London with Virgin Atlantic - meaning I had to scrap my planned holiday trip to Hong Kong and fly straight home - for which I also had to pay extra for even though they caused the route change. Having found previous long haul and Trans Tasman flights with Air New Zealand to be great I was extremely disappointed by this flight. The plane itself seemed very old and was not to clean boarding was very rushed felt like cattle being herded on board (the same leaving the plane too.) The flight was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and this was poorly dealt with by staff. Seating was extremely uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep at all for the 13hr duration and in flight entertainment was mediocre.

Our flight from Hong Kong to London was cancelled after ANZ dropped this route as being unprofitable prior to March this year (travelled in May). We had to make other arrangements as LA was not an option for us. The alternative offered was Cathay Pacific who provided a truly super service. However one of the reasons my wife and I choose ANZ internationally was to be able to use the lounge facilities in Hong Kong going out and in London Heathrow and Hong Kong returning. It just makes the 22 hour flight more bearable. However during the dropping of the London - Hong Kong sector ANZ have made no alternative lounge facilities through any other airline and the code share at Hong Kong does not allow a guest since March this year. I understand the need to rationalise flight sectors but the poor way ANZ staff handled the change in my case is very disappointing and not worthy of a so called 4 star airline.

At check in they tried to seat our party of two in different rows (eventually rectified). Got onboard the ancient 747 to find that half the archaic IFE (which had very limited options as it was) wasn't working so they had to reboot system (a long drawn out procedure). Slow disorganised service from the crew - very mixed bag with some putting in the effort and others completely uninterested and even rude at times when requesting things such as tissues. Disgusting meal (first choice ran out in 7 rows) and missed for drink services twice by the Flight Services Manager!
